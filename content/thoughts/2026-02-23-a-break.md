After a year of daily posts, I'm taking a brief pause.

Not stepping away — call it 'creative refinement.'

Over the past 16 months of really intense focus and work, this platform has been generous. I've connected with people doing remarkable work, learned from conversations I never expected, and refined my thinking through your questions and challenges.

That engagement revealed something important: The content that created real connection wasn't what I strategically planned to talk about — it was what emerged naturally from curiosity and genuine conversations.

So I'm taking time to get more intentional.

What's most valuable for me to create?
What am I most interested in learning and writing about?
How can I serve others better?
What conversations actually matter?

I'll still be here — engaging, reading, learning from your posts. But just being more deliberate about what I share next.

If something I've written over the past year+ resonated with you or helped in any way, I'd genuinely love to hear what it was. That feedback shapes where this goes.
