# The Scaffolding of the Self: What Holds When the Fiction Breaks

**Description**: Traces how the constructed self—maintained through denial, narrative, and social consensus—unravels under crisis, and what emerges from the rubble across psychology, philosophy, and fiction.

**Rationale**: Becker's death-denial, Fromm's freedom-flight, Postman's 'now…this' fragmentation, and Dostoyevsky's underground man converge on the same terrifying question: what are we without our fictions?

### Trail Synthesis

What the self actually is — whether it's the person we present to others, the story we tell ourselves, or some substrate underneath both — is the trail's central problem. Ernest Becker starts there: the self is not an authentic core but a defensive architecture, built in childhood to keep the knowledge of death from becoming unbearable. Every belief, habit, and persona we hold dear is, at its root, a stay against annihilation. This is not a comfortable premise, but it is the load-bearing one. Once you accept it, everything else follows: Fromm's two paths appear (double down on the scaffolding, or dismantle it and build something harder), Pinker's experiment confirms the truth was in there all along even when we couldn't face it, and Tolstoy's Oblonsky produces an idiotic smile in the precise moment when a real response would cost him too much. Postman reveals the cultural version of the same mechanism: a media structure of disconnected "Now...this" fragments that prevents the self from ever dwelling long enough on any reality to feel the dread Becker described.

The trail's second movement shows what happens when the scaffolding fails anyway. Raskolnikov's collapse is total — love inverts to hatred, reason dissolves, identity fragments into pursuit of his own guilt. Lispector's G.H. speaks from the far side of that collapse: the formless terror that waits when every constructed identity is stripped away, the need to invent an imaginary hand to hold just to begin to speak. Hugo's Valjean faces a subtler version — a life rebuilt as scaffolding over a buried name suddenly trembles when Jean Valjean resurfaces — and discovers the earthquake might actually solidify his edifice. Brené Brown closes the trail not with a promise of a new, more durable structure but with something more difficult: vulnerability as a daily practice, the deliberate choice to stand exposed where Becker's character armor once stood. The self that survives the fiction's collapse is not better built — it is more honestly inhabited.

## Trail Excerpts

### Excerpt 1: Denial of Death, The   Ernest Becker

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Becker, channeling Kierkegaard, establishes the foundational architecture of the trail: the self is a defensive structure—a 'characterological lie'—erected against the terror of death, and character itself is the scaffolding that keeps us in half-obscurity about what we really are.

> The spirit cannot do away with itself [i.e., self-consciousness cannot disappear]…. Neither can man sink down into the vegetative life [i.e., be wholly an animal]…. He cannot flee from dread.

8

But the real focus of dread is not the ambiguity itself, it is the result of

the judgment

on man: that if Adam eats of the fruit of the tree of knowledge God tells him “Thou shalt surely die.” In other words,

the final terror of self-consciousness is the knowledge of one’s own death, which is the peculiar sentence on man alone in the animal kingdom. This is the meaning of the Garden of Eden myth and the rediscovery of modern psychology: that death is man’s peculiar and greatest anxiety.

*

Kierkegaard’s Characterology

Kierkegaard’s whole understanding of man’s character is that it is a structure built up to avoid perception of the “terror, perdition [and] annihilation [that] dwell next door to every man.”

9

He understood psychology the way a contemporary psychoanalyst does: that its task is to discover the strategies that a person uses to avoid anxiety. What style does he use to function automatically and uncritically in the world, and how does this style cripple his true growth and freedom of action and choice? Or, in words that are almost Kierkegaard’s: **how is a person being enslaved by his characterological lie about himself?**

Kierkegaard described these styles with a brilliance that today seems uncanny and with a vocabulary that sums up much of the psychoanalytic theory of character defenses. Whereas today we talk about the “mechanisms of defense” such as repression and denial, Kierkegaard talked about the same things with different terms: he referred to the fact that most men live in a “half-obscurity” about their own condition,

10

they are in a state of “shut-upness” wherein they block off their own perceptions of reality.

11

He understood the compulsive character, the rigidity of the person who has had to build extra-thick defenses against anxiety, a heavy character armor, and he described him in the following terms:

A partisan of the most rigid orthodoxy… knows it all, he bows before the holy, truth is for him an ensemble of ceremonies, he talks about presenting himself before the throne of God, of how many times one must bow, he knows everything the same way as does the pupil who is able to demonstrate a mathematical proposition with the letters ABC, but not when they are changed to DEF. He is therefore in dread whenever he hears something not arranged in the same order.

12

There is no doubt that by “shut-upness” Kierkegaard means what we today refer to by repression; it is the closed personality, the one who has fenced himself around in childhood, not tested his own powers in action, not been free to discover himself and his world in a relaxed way. If the child is not burdened by too much parental blocking of his action, too much infection with the parents’ anxieties, he can develop his defenses in a less monopolizing way, can remain somewhat fluid and open in character. He is prepared to test reality more in terms of his own action and experimentation and less on the basis of delegated authority and prejudgment or preperception. Kierkegaard understood this difference by making a distinction between “lofty” shut-upness and “mistaken” shut-upness. He went on to give a Rousseau-like enjoinder for raising children with the right kind of character orientation:

### Excerpt 2: Escape from Freedom   Erich Fromm

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Fromm maps the critical fork that appears once the self's original scaffolding collapses: either progress toward authentic freedom or flee into new dependencies that trade individuality for the illusion of security—the same compulsive escape Becker identified as character armor.

> Once the primary bonds which gave security to the individual are severed, once the individual faces the world outside of himself as a completely separate entity, two courses are open to him since he has to overcome the unbearable state of powerlessness and aloneness. By one course he can progress to “positive freedom”; he can relate himself spontaneously to the world in love and work, in the genuine expression of his emotional, sensuous, and intellectual capacities; he can thus become one again with man, nature, and himself, without giving up the independence and integrity of his individual self. The other course open to him is to fall back, to give up his freedom, and to try to overcome his aloneness by eliminating the gap that has arisen between his individual self and the world. This second course never reunites him with the world in the way he was related to it before he merged as an “individual,” for the fact of his separateness cannot be reversed; it is an escape from an unbearable situation which would make life impossible if it were prolonged. This course of escape, therefore, is characterized by its compulsive character, like every escape from threatening panic; it is also characterized by the more or less

complete surrender of individuality and the integrity of the self. Thus it is not a solution which leads to happiness and positive freedom; it is, in principle, a solution which is to be found in all neurotic phenomena. It assuages an unbearable anxiety and makes life possible by avoiding panic; yet it does not solve the underlying problem and is paid for by a kind of life that often consists only of automatic or compulsive activities.

Some of these mechanisms of escape are of relatively small social import; they are to be found in any marked degree only in individuals with severe mental and emotional disturbances. In this chapter I shall discuss only those mechanisms which are culturally significant and the understanding of which is a necessary premise for the psychological analysis of the social phenomena with which we shall deal in the following chapters: the Fascist system, on one hand, modern democracy, on the other.

1. Authoritarianism

The first mechanism to escape from freedom I am going to deal with is the tendency to give up the independence of one’s own individual self and to fuse one’s self with somebody or something outside of oneself in order to acquire the strength which the individual self is lacking. Or, to put it in different words, to

seek for new, “secondary bonds” as a substitute for the primary bonds which have been lost.

The more distinct forms of this mechanism are to be found in the striving for submission and domination, or, as we would rather put it, in the masochistic and sadistic strivings as they exist in varying degrees in normal and neurotic persons respectively. We shall first describe these tendencies and then try to show that both of them are an escape from an unbearable aloneness.

### Excerpt 3: Better Angels of Our Nature  Why Violence Has Declined, The   Steven Pinker

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Pinker provides empirical evidence for the self's scaffolding in action: self-deception is not ignorance but active construction, and the buried truth surfaces only when the conscious spin doctor is momentarily disabled—proving the fiction is maintained against knowledge, not in its absence.

> They asked the participants to cooperate with them in planning and evaluating a study in which half of them would get a pleasant and easy task, namely looking through photographs for ten minutes, and half would get a tedious and difficult one, namely solving math problems for fortyfive minutes. They told the participants that they were being run in pairs, but that the experimenters had not yet settled on the best way to decide who got which task. So they allowed each participant to choose one of two methods to decide who would get the pleasant task and who would get the unpleasant  one. The participants could just choose the easy task for themselves, or they could use a random number generator to decide who got which. Human selfishness being what it is, almost everyone kept the pleasant task for themselves. Later they were given an anonymous questionnaire to evaluate the experiment which unobtrusively slipped in a question about whether the participants thought that their decision had been fair. Human hypocrisy being what it is, most of them said it was. Then the experimenters described the selfish choice to another group of participants and asked them how fairly the selfish subject acted. Not surprisingly, they didn’t think it was fair at all. The difference between the way people judge other people’s behavior and the way they judge their own behavior is a classic instance of a self-serving bias.

But now comes the key question. Did the self-servers

really

, deep down, believe that they were acting fairly? Or did the conscious spin doctor in their brains just say that, while the unconscious reality-checker registered the truth? To find out, the psychologists

tied up

the conscious mind by forcing a group of participants to keep seven digits in memory while they evaluated the experiment, including the judgment about whether they (or others) had acted fairly. **With the conscious mind distracted, the terrible truth came out: the participants judged themselves as harshly as they judged other people**. This vindicates Trivers’s theory that **the truth was in there all along**.

I was happy to discover the result, not just because the theory of self-deception is so elegant that it deserves to be true, but because it offers a glimmer of hope for humanity. Though acknowledging a compromising truth about ourselves is among our most painful experiences—Freud posited an armamentarium of defense mechanisms to postpone that dreadful day, such as denial, repression, projection, and reaction formation—it is, at least in principle, possible. It may take ridicule, it may take argument, it may take time, it may take being distracted, but people have the means to recognize that they are not always in the right. Still, we shouldn’t deceive ourselves about self-deception. In the absence of these puncturings, the overwhelming tendency is for people to misjudge the harmful acts they have perpetrated or experienced.

Once you become aware of this fateful quirk in our psychology, social life begins to look different, and so do history and current events. It’s not just that there are two sides to every dispute. It’s that each side

sincerely

believes its version of the story, namely that it is an innocent and long-suffering victim and the other side a malevolent and treacherous sadist. And each side has assembled a historical narrative and database of facts consistent with its sincere belief.

### Excerpt 4: A Room with a View   E.M. Forster

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Forster dramatizes Fromm's second path in miniature: Lucy consciously chooses the scaffolding of convention over authentic selfhood, and the narrator prophesies the slow rot that follows—pleasantry cracking into cynicism, piety into hypocrisy—when the enemy within goes unconfronted.

> believed in her; she must some day believe in herself. She must be one of the

women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for liberty and not for men;

she must forget that George loved her, that George had been thinking through

her and gained her this honourable release, that George had gone away

into—what was it?—the darkness.

She put out the lamp.

It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel. She gave up

trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the benighted, who

follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to their destiny by

catch-words. The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk. But they have

yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy within. They have sinned

against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after virtue. As the

years pass, they are censured. Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks,

their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and

produce discomfort wherever they go. They have sinned against Eros and against

Pallas Athene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary course

of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.

Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not love him,

and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one. The night received her, as it had

received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.

Chapter XVIII

Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants

Windy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred feet down

the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses that

supported the hill. On either side of it was a shallow ravine, filled with

ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the

Weald.

Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble

dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy

Corner,—he laughed. The situation was so glorious, the house so

commonplace, not to say impertinent. The late Mr. Honeychurch had affected the

cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his money, and the only

addition made by his widow had been a small turret, shaped like a rhinoceros’

horn, where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down

the road. So impertinent—and yet the house “did,” for it was the home of

people who loved their surroundings honestly. Other houses in the neighborhood

had been built by expensive architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted

sedulously, yet all these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy

Corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation. One might

laugh at the house, but one never shuddered. Mr. Beebe was bicycling over this

Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip. He had heard from the Miss Alans.

These admirable ladies, since they could not go to Cissie Villa, had changed

their plans. They were going to Greece instead.

“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine, “we do

not see why we should not try Athens this winter. Of course, Athens is a

plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread; but, after all,

we can take that with us, and it is only getting first into a steamer and then

into a train. But is there an English Church?” And the letter went on to say:

### Excerpt 5: Anna Karenina   Leo Tolstoy

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Tolstoy captures the scaffolding of the self betraying itself in a single reflex: Oblonsky's body produces the habitual smile even as his world collapses, revealing how deeply character armor is embedded—and how the constructed self can crack not through insight but through a spinal-action failure of its own mask.

> in one’s thoughts awake.” And noticing a gleam of light peeping in

beside one of the serge curtains, he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge

of the sofa, and felt about with them for his slippers, a present on his last

birthday, worked for him by his wife on gold-colored morocco. And, as he had

done every day for the last nine years, he stretched out his hand, without

getting up, towards the place where his dressing-gown always hung in his

bedroom. And thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his

wife’s room, but in his study, and why: the smile vanished from his face,

he knitted his brows.

“Ah, ah, ah! Oo!...” he muttered, recalling everything that had

happened. And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was present to

his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, and worst of all, his

own fault.

“Yes, she won’t forgive me, and she can’t forgive me. And the

most awful thing about it is that it’s all my fault—all my fault,

though I’m not to blame. That’s the point of the whole

situation,” he reflected. “Oh, oh, oh!” he kept repeating in

despair, as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this

quarrel.

Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and

good-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his wife, he

had not found his wife in the drawing-room, to his surprise had not found her

in the study either, and saw her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter

that revealed everything in her hand.

She, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details, and

limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still with the

letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of horror, despair, and

indignation.

“What’s this? this?” she asked, pointing to the letter.

And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the case, was not

so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had met his

wife’s words.

There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when they are

unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful. He did not succeed in

adapting his face to the position in which he was placed towards his wife by

the discovery of his fault. Instead of being hurt, denying, defending himself,

begging forgiveness, instead of remaining indifferent even—anything would

have been better than what he did do—his face utterly involuntarily

(reflex spinal action, reflected Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of

physiology)—utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual, good-humored, and

therefore idiotic smile.

This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself. Catching sight of that smile,

Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her characteristic

heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the room. Since then she

had refused to see her husband.

“It’s that idiotic smile that’s to blame for it all,”

thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.

“But what’s to be done? What’s to be done?” he said to

himself in despair, and found no answer.

Chapter 2

Stepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself. He was

incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he repented of his

conduct. He could not at this date repent of the fact that he, a handsome,

susceptible man of thirty-four, was not in love with his wife, the mother of

five living and two dead children, and only a year younger than himself. All he

**Author**: None

> new way of conducting its business, especially its important business. The nature of its discourse is changing as the demarcation line between what is show business and what is not becomes harder to see with each passing day. Our priests and presidents, our surgeons and lawyers, our educators and newscasters need worry less about satisfying the demands of their discipline than the demands of good showmanship. Had Irving Berlin changed one word in the title of his celebrated song, he would have been as prophetic, albeit more terse, as Aldous Huxley. He need only have written, There’s No Business But Show Business.

“Now…This”

The American humorist H. Allen Smith once suggested that of all the worrisome words in the English language, the scariest is “uh oh,” as when a physician looks at your X-rays, and with knitted brow says, “Uh oh.” I should like to suggest that the words which are the title of this chapter are as ominous as any, all the more so because they are spoken without knitted brow—indeed, with a kind of idiot’s delight. The phrase, if that’s what it may be called, adds to our grammar a new part of speech, **a conjunction that does not connect anything to anything but does the opposite: separates everything from everything**. As such, it serves as a compact metaphor for the discontinuities in so much that passes for public discourse in present-day America.

“Now…this” is commonly used on radio and television newscasts to indicate that what one has just heard or seen has no relevance to what one is about to hear or see, or possibly to anything one is ever likely to hear or see. The phrase is a means of acknowledging the fact that the world as mapped by the speeded-up electronic media has no order or meaning and is not to be taken seriously. There is no murder so brutal, no earthquake so devastating, no political blunder so costly—for that matter, no ball score so tantalizing or weather report so threatening—that it cannot be erased from our minds by a newscaster saying, “Now…this.” The newscaster means that you have thought long enough on the previous matter (approximately forty-five seconds), that you must not be morbidly

preoccupied with it (let us say, for ninety seconds), and that you must now give your attention to another fragment of news or a commercial.

Television did not invent the “Now…this” world view. As I have tried to show, it is the offspring of the intercourse between telegraphy and photography. But it is through television that it has been nurtured and brought to a perverse maturity. For on television, nearly every half hour is a discrete event, separated in content, context, and emotional texture from what precedes and follows it. In part because television sells its time in seconds and minutes, in part because television must use images rather than words, in part because its audience can move freely to and from the television set, programs are structured so that almost each eight-minute segment may stand as a complete event in itself. Viewers are rarely required to carry over any thought or feeling from one parcel of time to another.

Of course, in television’s presentation of the “news of the day,” we may see the “Now…this” mode of discourse in its boldest and most embarrassing form. For there, we are presented not only with fragmented news but **news without context, without consequences, without value, and therefore without essential seriousness**; that is to say, news as pure entertainment.

### Excerpt 7: Crime and Punishment   Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Constance Garnett

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Raskolnikov embodies the self in total structural collapse: love inverts to hatred, memory dissolves into delirium, and identity fragments into a dreamlike pursuit of his own guilt—every scaffolding of relationship, reason, and narrative has given way, leaving only raw dread and physical revulsion.

> His hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his

eyes were fixed on the ceiling.

"Mother, sister—how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate

them, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can't bear them near me....

I went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember.... To embrace her

and think if she only knew... shall I tell her then? That's just what

I might do....

She

must be the same as I am," he added, straining

himself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. "Ah, how I hate

the old woman now! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!

Poor Lizaveta! Why did she come in?... It's strange though, why is it

I scarcely ever think of her, as though I hadn't killed her? Lizaveta!

Sonia! Poor gentle things, with gentle eyes.... Dear women! Why don't

they weep? Why don't they moan? They give up everything... their eyes

are soft and gentle.... Sonia, Sonia! Gentle Sonia!"

He lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didn't remember

how he got into the street. It was late evening. The twilight had fallen

and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a

peculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in the

street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other

people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and

stagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was

distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do

something in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he

stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,

beckoning to him. He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and

walked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to

him. "Stay, did he really beckon?" Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried

to overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and

was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long

coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;

they went down a turning; the man still did not look round. "Does he

know I am following him?" thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the

gateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in

to see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard

the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at

once followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have

gone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard

slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely

familiar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone

through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he

reached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were

at work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps

of the man above had died away. "So he must have stopped or hidden

somewhere." He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was a

stillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own

footsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be

hiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he

### Excerpt 8: The Passion According to G.H    Clarice Lispector

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Lispector voices what emerges after every constructed identity has been stripped away: not liberation but formless terror, a vastness where truth doesn't make sense and the self must invent a hand to hold—the raw experience of being that Becker's scaffolding was built to prevent.

> grasping the haunted hand of the God, and entering that formless thing that is a

paradise. A paradise that I don’t want!

While writing and speaking I will have to pretend that someone is

holding my hand.

Oh, at least at the beginning, just at the beginning. As soon as I can

let go, I will go alone. In the meantime I must hold this hand of yours — though I

can’t invent your face and your eyes and your mouth. Yet even amputated, that hand

doesn’t scare me. Its invention comes from such an idea of love as if the hand

really were attached to a body that I don’t see only because I can’t love enough. I

cannot imagine a whole person because I am not a whole person. And how can I imagine

a face without knowing what expression I need? As soon as I can release your warm

hand, I’ll go alone and with horror. The horror will be my responsibility until the

metamorphosis is complete and the horror becomes light. Not the light born of a

desire for beauty and moralism, as before without realizing I intended; but the

natural light of whatever exists, and it is that natural light that terrorizes me.

Though I know that the horror — I am the horror in the face of things.

For now I am inventing your presence, just as one day I won’t know how

to risk dying alone, dying is the greatest risk of all, I won’t know how to enter

death and take the first step into the first absence of me — just as in this last

and so primary hour I shall invent your unknown presence and with you shall begin to

die until I learn all by myself not to exist, and then I shall let you go. For now I

cling to you, and your unknown and warm life is my only intimate organization, I who

without your hand would feel set loose into the enormous vastness I discovered. Into

the vastness of the truth?

But the truth never made sense to me. The truth doesn’t make sense! That

is why I feared it and fear it. Helpless, I give you everything—so you can make a

joyous thing of it. Will speaking to you scare you and make me lose you? but if I

don’t speak I’ll be lost, and in losing myself lose you.

The truth doesn’t make sense, the greatness of the world restricts me.

What I probably asked for and finally got, left me needy as a child wandering the

earth alone. So needy that only the love of the entire universe for me could console

me and overwhelm me, only a love that trembled the very egg-cell of things with what

I am calling a love. With what I can really only call but without knowing its name.

Could what I saw have been love? But what love is as blind as that of an

egg-cell? was that it? that horror, was that love? a love so neutral that — no, I

still don’t want to speak to myself, speaking now would hasten a meaning like

someone swiftly freezing into the paralyzing security of a third leg. Or am I just

putting off starting to speak? why don’t I just say nothing and simply buy some

time? Out of fear. I need courage to venture making something concrete out of my

feeling. It’s like having a coin and not knowing in which country it is legal

tender.

possible? When I reflect that yesterday I was so tranquil, and so far

from suspecting anything! What was I doing yesterday at this hour? What

is there in this incident? What will the end be? What is to be done?"

This was the torment in which he found himself. His brain had lost its

power of retaining ideas; they passed like waves, and he clutched his

brow in both hands to arrest them.

Nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmed

his will and his reason, and from which he sought to draw proof and

resolution.

His head was burning. He went to the window and threw it wide open.

There were no stars in the sky. He returned and seated himself at the

table.

The first hour passed in this manner.

Gradually, however, vague outlines began to take form and to fix

themselves in his meditation, and he was able to catch a glimpse with

precision of the reality,—not the whole situation, but some of

the details. He began by recognizing the fact that, critical and

extraordinary as was this situation, he was completely master of it.

This only caused an increase of his stupor.

Independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to

his actions, all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a

hole in which to bury his name. That which he had always feared most of

all in his hours of self-communion, during his sleepless nights, was to

ever hear that name pronounced; he had said to himself, that that would

be the end of all things for him; that on the day when that name made

its reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about

him, and—who knows?—perhaps even his new soul within him, also. He

shuddered at the very thought that this was possible. Assuredly, if any

one had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that

name would ring in his ears, when the hideous words, Jean Valjean, would

suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him, when that

formidable light, capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had

enveloped himself, would suddenly blaze forth above his head, and that

that name would not menace him, that that light would but produce

an obscurity more dense, that this rent veil would but increase the

mystery, that this earthquake would solidify his edifice, that this

prodigious incident would have no other result, so far as he was

concerned, if so it seemed good to him, than that of rendering his

existence at once clearer and more impenetrable, and that, out of his

confrontation with the phantom of Jean Valjean, the good and worthy

citizen Monsieur Madeleine would emerge more honored, more peaceful, and

more respected than ever—if any one had told him that, he would have

tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman. Well, all

this was precisely what had just come to pass; all that accumulation of

impossibilities was a fact, and God had permitted these wild fancies to

become real things!

His revery continued to grow clearer. He came more and more to an

understanding of his position.

It seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicable

dream, and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middle

of the night, erect, shivering, holding back all in vain, on the very

### Excerpt 10: Daring Greatly  How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead   Brené Brown

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Brown offers the trail's resolution: after the scaffolding of denial and perfectionism collapses, what can be rebuilt is not another defensive structure but a practice of vulnerability—the deliberate choice to stand exposed where Becker's character armor once stood, finding worthiness not despite the rubble but within it.

> I defined ten “guideposts” for Wholehearted living that point to what the Wholehearted work to cultivate and what they work to let go of:

Cultivating Authenticity: Letting Go of What People Think

Cultivating Self-Compassion: Letting Go of Perfectionism

Cultivating a Resilient Spirit: Letting Go of Numbing and Powerlessness

Cultivating Gratitude and Joy: Letting Go of Scarcity and Fear of the Dark

Cultivating Intuition and Trusting Faith: Letting Go of the Need for Certainty

Cultivating Creativity: Letting Go of Comparison

Cultivating Play and Rest: Letting Go of Exhaustion as a Status Symbol and Productivity as Self-Worth

Cultivating Calm and Stillness: Letting Go of Anxiety as a Lifestyle

Cultivating Meaningful Work: Letting Go of Self-Doubt and “Supposed To”

Cultivating Laughter, Song, and Dance: Letting Go of Being Cool and “Always in Control”

As I analyzed the data, I realized that I was about two for ten in my own life when it comes to Wholehearted living. That was personally devastating. This happened a few weeks before my forty-first birthday and sparked my midlife unraveling. As it turns out, getting an intellectual handle on these issues isn’t the same as living and loving with your whole heart.

I have written in great detail in

The Gifts of Imperfection

about what it means to be Wholehearted and about the

breakdown

spiritual awakening that ensued from this realization. But what I want to do here is to share the definition of Wholehearted living and share the five most important themes that emerged from the data and which led me to the breakthroughs I share in this book. It will give you an idea of what’s ahead:

Wholehearted living is about engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness. It means cultivating the courage, compassion, and connection to wake up in the morning and think,

**No matter what gets done and how much is left undone, I am enough**.

It’s going to bed at night thinking,

Yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable and sometimes afraid, but that doesn’t change the truth that I am also brave and worthy of love and belonging.

This definition is based on these fundamental ideals:

Love and belonging are irreducible needs of all men, women, and children. We’re hardwired for connection—it’s what gives purpose

and meaning to our lives. The absence of love, belonging, and connection always leads to suffering.

If you roughly divide the men and women I’ve interviewed into two groups—those who feel a deep sense of love and belonging, and those who struggle for it—there’s only one variable that separates the groups: Those who feel lovable, who love, and who experience belonging simply believe they are

worthy

of love and belonging. They don’t have better or easier lives, they don’t have fewer struggles with addiction or depression, and they haven’t survived fewer traumas or bankruptcies or divorces, but in the midst of all of these struggles, they have developed practices that enable them to hold on to the belief that they are worthy of love, belonging, and even joy.

A strong belief in our worthiness doesn’t just happen—it’s cultivated when we understand the guideposts as choices and daily practices.

The main concern of Wholehearted men and women is living a life defined by courage, compassion, and connection.

The Wholehearted identify vulnerability as the catalyst for courage, compassion, and connection. In fact, **the willingness to be vulnerable emerged as the single clearest value shared by all of the women and men whom I would describe as Wholehearted**. They attribute everything—from their professional success to

their marriages to their proudest parenting moments—to their ability to be vulnerable.
