# The Manufacture of Expendability: Race, Suspicion, and the Legal Architecture of Disposable Lives

**Description**: Traces how legal systems, racial psychology, and narrative construct the 'expendable man' — from Bigger Thomas's entrapment in Native Son, through Hugh Densmore's racialized vulnerability in The Expendable Man, to the structural machinery of mass incarceration in The New Jim Crow, with historical roots in Frederick Douglass and the origins of totalitarian logic in Arendt.

**Rationale**: This trail synthesizes fiction, memoir, legal analysis, and political theory to reveal how the 'suspect body' is not a natural category but a product of interlocking systems that render certain citizens permanently precarious — connecting the psychological interiority of racialized fear to the bureaucratic machinery that enforces it.

## Trail Excerpts

### Excerpt 1: Native Son   Richard Wright

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Wright's 1940 alarm establishes the foundational premise of the entire trail: that America's racial architecture produces dehumanized, expendable lives through a self-reinforcing system of segregation, fantasy, and willful blindness—a system whose legal and psychological machinery the subsequent texts will anatomize.

Introduction

The sound of the alarm that opens

Native Son

was Richard Wright’s

urgent call in 1940 to America to awaken from its self-induced slumber about the reality of race relations in the nation. As proud, rich, and powerful as America was, Wright insisted, **the nation was facing a grave danger, one that would ultimately destroy the United States if its dimensions and devious complexity were not recognized**.

Native Son

was intended to be America’s guide in confronting this danger.

Wright believed that few Americans, black or white, were prepared to face squarely and honestly the most profound consequences of more than two centuries of the enslavement and segregation of blacks in North America. **The dehumanization of African Americans during slavery had been followed in the long aftermath of the Civil War by their often brutal repression in the South and by conditions of life in many respects equally severe in the nominally integrated North**. Nevertheless, Wright knew, **blacks and whites alike continued to cling to a range of fantasies about the true nature of the relationship between the races even as the nation lurched inexorably toward a possible collapse** over the fundamental question of justice for the despised African American minority.

### Excerpt 2: The New Jim Crow   Michelle Alexander

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Erma Faye Stewart's coerced guilty plea and Clifford Runoalds's arrest at his daughter's funeral are contemporary enactments of the entrapment Wright dramatized through Bigger Thomas—the legal system manufactures guilt and expendability through structural pressure that leaves Black Americans with no viable choices.

> magine you are Erma Faye Stewart, a thirty-year-old, single African American mother of two who was arrested as part of a drug sweep in Hearne, Texas.

1

All but one of the people arrested were African American. You are innocent. After a week in jail, you have no one to care for your two small children and are eager to get home. Your court-appointed attorney urges you to plead guilty to a drug distribution charge, saying the prosecutor has offered probation. You refuse, steadfastly proclaiming your innocence. Finally, after almost a month in jail, you decide to plead guilty so you can return home to your children. Unwilling to risk a trial and years of imprisonment, you are sentenced to ten years’ probation and ordered to pay $1,000 in fines, as well as court and probation costs. You are also now branded a drug felon. You are no longer eligible for food stamps; you may be discriminated against in employment; you cannot vote for at least twelve years; and you are about to be evicted from public housing. Once homeless, your children will be taken from you and put in foster care.

A judge eventually dismisses all cases against the defendants who did not plead guilty. At trial, the judge finds that the entire sweep was based on the testimony of a single informant who lied to the prosecution. You, however, are still branded a drug felon, homeless, and desperate to regain custody of your children. Now place yourself in the shoes of Clifford Runoalds, another African American victim of

the Hearne drug bust.

2

You returned home to Bryan, Texas, to attend the funeral of your eighteen-month-old daughter. Before the funeral services begin, the police show up and handcuff you. You beg the officers to let you take one last look at your daughter before she is buried. The police refuse. You are told by prosecutors that you are needed to testify against one of the defendants in a recent drug bust. You deny witnessing any drug transaction; you don’t know what they are talking about. Because of your refusal to cooperate, you are indicted on felony charges. After a month of being held in jail, the charges against you are dropped. You are technically free, but as a result of your arrest and period of incarceration, you lose your job, your apartment, your furniture, and your car. Not to mention the chance to say good-bye to your baby girl.

This is the War on Drugs. The brutal stories described above are not isolated incidents, nor are the racial identities of Erma Faye Stewart and Clifford Runoalds random or accidental. In every state across our nation, African Americans—particularly in the poorest neighborhoods—are subjected to tactics and practices that would result in public outrage and scandal if committed in middle-class white neighborhoods. **In the drug war, the enemy is racially defined**. The law enforcement methods described in

chapter 2

have been employed almost exclusively in poor communities of color, resulting in jaw-dropping numbers of African Americans and Latinos filling our nation’s prisons and jails every year. We are told by drug warriors that the enemy in this war is a thing—drugs—not a group of people, but the facts prove otherwise.

Human Rights Watch reported in 2000 that, **in seven states, African Americans constitute 80 to 90 percent of all those sent to prison on drug charges**.

3

In at least fifteen states, blacks are admitted to prison on drug charges at a rate from twenty to fifty-seven times greater than that of white men.

### Excerpt 3: The New Jim Crow   Michelle Alexander

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: The Supreme Court's formal authorization of race as a permissible factor in policing reveals the legal architecture that transforms racial identity into grounds for suspicion—the juridical mechanism by which the state constructs expendable populations whose bodies are always already suspect.

> The truth, however, is this: at other stages of the criminal justice process, the Court has indicated that overt racial bias necessarily triggers strict scrutiny—a concession that has not been costly, as very few law enforcement officials today are foolish enough to admit bias openly. But the Supreme Court has indicated that in policing, race

can

be used as a factor in discretionary decision making. In

United States v. Brignoni-Ponce

, the Court concluded it was permissible under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for the police to use race as a factor in making decisions about which motorists to stop and search. In that case, the Court concluded that the police could take a person’s Mexican appearance into account when developing reasonable suspicion that a vehicle may contain undocumented immigrants. The Court said that “**the likelihood that any person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor**.”

95

Some commentators have argued that

Brignoni-Ponce

may be limited to the immigration context; the Court might not apply the same principle to drug-law enforcement. It is not obvious what the rational basis would be for limiting overt race discrimination by police to immigration. The likelihood that a person of Mexican ancestry is an “alien” could not be significantly higher than the likelihood that any random black person is a “drug criminal.”

The Court’s quiet blessing of **race-based traffic stops has led to something of an Orwellian public discourse regarding racial profiling**. Police departments and highway patrol agencies frequently declare, “We do not engage in racial profiling,” even though their officers routinely use race as a factor when making decisions regarding whom to stop and search. The justification for the implicit doublespeak—“we do not racial-profile; we just stop people based on race”—can be explained in part by the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence. Because the Supreme Court has authorized the police to use race as a factor when making decisions regarding whom to stop and search, police departments believe that racial profiling exists only when race is the

sole

factor. Thus, if race is one factor but not the only factor, then it doesn’t really count as a factor at all.

The absurdity of this logic is evidenced by the fact that police almost never claim to stop anyone solely because of race. A young black male wearing baggy pants, standing in front of his high school surrounded

by a group of similarly dressed black friends, may be stopped and searched because police believe he “looks like” a drug dealer. The police can easily argue, if challenged, that non-racial factors – such as gender, age, attire and location – played a role in their assessment.

The problem, of course, is that whether or not race is the sole reason for a stop or search, it is frequently a

determinative

reason. A young white male wearing baggy pants, standing in front of his high school and surrounded by his friends, might well be ignored by police officers. It might never occur to them that a group of young white kids might be dealing dope in front of their high school. Similarly situated people inevitably are treated differently when police are granted permission to rely on racial stereotypes when making discretionary decisions.

### Excerpt 4: The New Jim Crow   Michelle Alexander

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Alexander exposes how the architecture of expendability operates through spatial and legal feedback loops: segregation creates the ghetto, the ghetto generates 'high crime' designations, and those designations justify the surveillance that produces criminal records—a self-fulfilling prophecy that echoes the environmental determinism Wright depicted in Bigger Thomas's South Side Chicago.

> Equally important, though, the sole-factor test ignores the ways in which **seemingly race-neutral factors—such as location—operate in a highly discriminatory fashion**. Some law enforcement officials claim that they would stop and search white kids wearing baggy jeans in the ghetto (that would be suspicious)—it just so happens they’re rarely there. Subjecting people to stops and searches because they live in “high crime” ghettos cannot be said to be truly race-neutral, given that **the ghetto itself was constructed to contain and control groups of people defined by race**.

96

Even seemingly race-neutral factors such as “prior criminal history” are not truly race-neutral. A black kid arrested twice for possession of marijuana may be no more of a “repeat offender” than a white frat boy who regularly smokes pot in his dorm room. But because of his race and his confinement to a racially segregated ghetto, the black kid has a criminal record, while the white frat boy, because of his race and relative privilege, does not. Thus, when prosecutors throw the book at black youth who have multiple arrests or convictions, or when police stalk people with criminal records and subject them to regular frisks and searches on the grounds that it makes sense to “watch criminals closely,” they are often exacerbating

racial disparities created by the discretionary decision to wage the War on Drugs almost exclusively in poor communities of color.

Defending against claims of racial bias in policing is easy. Because police officers never offer race as the only reason for a stop or search, any police officer, even the most racist, will be able to cite multiple nonracial reasons for initiating an encounter, including any number of the so-called “indicators” of drug trafficking discussed in

chapter 2

, such as appearing too nervous or too calm. Police officers (like prosecutors) are highly adept at offering race-neutral reasons for actions that consistently disadvantage African Americans. Whereas prosecutors claim they strike black jurors not because of their race but because of their hairstyle, police officers have their own stock excuses—e.g., “Your honor, we didn’t stop him because he’s black; we stopped him because he failed to use his turn signal at the right time,” or “It wasn’t just because he was black; it was also because he seemed nervous when he saw the police car.” Judges are just as reluctant to second-guess an officer’s motives as they are to second-guess prosecutors’. So long as officers refrain from uttering racial epithets and so long as they show the good sense not to say “the only reason I stopped him was ’cause he’s black,” courts generally turn a blind eye to patterns of discrimination by the police.

Studies of racial profiling have shown that police do, in fact, exercise their discretion regarding whom to stop and search in the drug war in a highly discriminatory manner.

97

Not only do police discriminate in their determinations regarding where to wage the war, but they also discriminate in their judgments regarding whom to target outside of the ghetto’s invisible walls.

The most famous of these studies were conducted in New Jersey and Maryland in the 1990s. Allegations of racial profiling in federally funded drug interdiction operations resulted in numerous investigations and comprehensive data demonstrating a dramatic pattern of racial bias in highway patrol stops and searches. These drug interdiction

programs were the brainchild of the DEA, part of the federally funded program known as Operation Pipeline.

### Excerpt 5: The New Jim Crow   Michelle Alexander

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: The mass scale of stop-and-frisk—half a million bodies subjected annually to state scrutiny with virtually no evidentiary yield—demonstrates that the purpose is not crime prevention but the ritualized performance of racial suspicion, enacting on hundreds of thousands of Black and Latino bodies the presumption of expendability that Bigger Thomas internalized as fate.

> Pedestrian stops, too, have been the subject of study and controversy. The New York Police Department released statistics in February 2007 showing that during the prior year its **officers stopped an astounding 508,540 people—an average of 1,393 per day—who were walking down the street**, perhaps on their way to the subway, grocery store, or bus stop. Often the stops included searches for illegal drugs or

guns—searches that frequently required people to lie face down on the pavement or stand spread-eagled against a wall while police officers aggressively groped all over their bodies while bystanders watched or walked by. The vast majority of those stopped and searched were racial minorities, and more than half were African American.

104

The NYPD began collecting data on pedestrian stops following the shooting of Amadou Diallo, an African immigrant who died in a hail of police bullets on the front steps of his own home in February 1999. Diallo was followed to his apartment building by four white police officers—members of the elite Street Crime Unit—who viewed him as suspicious and wanted to interrogate him. They ordered him to stop, but, according to the officers, Diallo did not respond immediately. He walked a bit farther to his apartment building, opened the door, and retrieved his wallet—probably to produce identification. The officers said they thought the wallet was a gun, and fired forty-one times. **Amadou Diallo died at the age of twenty-two. He was unarmed and had no criminal record**.

Diallo’s murder sparked huge protests, resulting in a series of studies commissioned by the attorney general of New York. The first study found that African Americans were stopped six times more frequently than whites, and that stops of African Americans were less likely to result in arrests than stops of whites—presumably because blacks were less likely to be found with drugs or other contraband.

105

Although the NYPD attempted to justify the stops on the grounds that they were designed to get guns off the street, stops by the Street Crime Unit—the group of officers who supposedly are specially trained to identify gun-toting thugs—yielded a weapon in only 2.5 percent of all stops.

106

Rather than reducing reliance on stop-and-frisk tactics following the Diallo shooting and the release of this disturbing data, the NYPD dramatically

increased

its number of pedestrian stops and continued to stop and frisk African Americans at grossly disproportionate rates. The NYPD stopped five times more people in 2005 than in 2002—the overwhelming majority of whom were African American or Latino.

107

By

2008, the NYPD was stopping 545,000 in a single year, and 80 percent of the people stopped were African Americans and Latinos. Whites comprised a mere 8 percent of people frisked by the NYPD, while African Americans accounted for 85 percent of all frisks.

108

A report by

The New York Times

found that the highest concentration of stops in the city was a roughly eight-block area of Brownsville, Brooklyn, that was predominately black. Residents there were stopped at a rate thirteen times the city average.

109

Although the NYPD frequently attempts to justify stop-and-frisk operations in poor communities of color on the grounds that such tactics are necessary to get guns off the streets, **less than 1 percent of stops (0.15 percent) resulted in guns being found, and guns and other contraband were seized less often in stops of African Americans and Latinos than of whites**.

110

### Excerpt 6: The New Jim Crow   Michelle Alexander

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: The woman's testimony—releasing personal anger once she recognized systemic forces—reveals how manufactured expendability is internalized as individual failure and familial betrayal, fracturing Black communities from within and completing the cycle of disposability that begins with policing and incarceration.

> first time since childhood. She realized that she had blamed her father for leaving her in her youth; the book helped her to see how his disappearance was largely a product of forces and systems beyond his control. Her experience is not unique. Over the years, many women have shared with me that reading

The New Jim Crow

allowed them to release some of the hurt and anger they felt toward black men in their lives—men they felt had betrayed them by returning to prison after promises not to do so, or who had failed to secure jobs or housing upon their release and were therefore unable to help support their families. As one woman put it, “I’m still angry that he can’t seem to get a good job, and that he’s been rearrested twice, and that I’m the one who has to feed our kids and bail him out. But now I don’t just blame him. **I see this whole system is working to keep us down**. And I want to do something about it.”

Some women, however, have expressed concern that the book may send the message to readers that the experience of women in the era of mass incarceration is less important or less worthy of public concern. It is certainly understandable why some would feel this way. In recent years, the overwhelming majority of funding and media attention has flowed toward addressing police killings of unarmed black men and their staggering incarceration rates; relatively little attention has been paid to the experience of black women.

I chose to focus on the experience of black men at a time when little attention was paid to the devastating impact of the drug war on black communities. I was inspired to write the book due to my experiences as a civil rights lawyer at the ACLU of Northern California, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, investigating patterns of drug law enforcement in communities of color and representing victims of racial profiling. The overwhelming majority of those who contacted my office to report being stopped, frisked, searched, or brutalized by the police were black men. When I began researching and writing this book, the number of people in prisons and jails for drug offenses had increased

more than 1,000 percent in thirty years, and black men were being swept into the system for minor drug crimes at grossly disproportionate rates. Stunningly, **one in three black men had a felony record in 2010** and it was predicted that if current trends continued, one in three black men would spend time in prison and the vast majority would acquire a criminal record during their lifetime. It seemed reasonable to me back then to focus on those who had been the primary targets of the war and whose experience I knew best. In the introduction, I acknowledged the limitations of my approach and urged other scholars and advocates to pick up where I left off.

In recent years, I’ve been thrilled to see the extraordinary activism and scholarship of those who have worked to move the experience of women in the era of mass incarceration from the margins to the center. Books such as Andrea Ritchie’s

Invisible No More: Police Violence Against Black Women and Women of Color

and

Becoming Ms. Burton: From Prison to Recovery to Leading the Fight for Incarcerated Women

### Excerpt 7: Origins of Totalitarianism, The   Hannah Arendt

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Arendt's analysis of statelessness reveals the prototype for all legal manufacture of expendability: when states strip persons of political belonging—whether through denaturalization, refugee status, or felony branding—they create rightless populations whose very existence becomes an administrative problem rather than a moral claim, prefiguring the civic death Alexander documents in mass incarceration.

> 1939: “**The status of a refugee is not, of course, a permanent one**. The aim is that he should rid himself of that status as soon as possible, either by repatriation or by naturalization in the country of refuge.”

[back]

30. Only the Russians, in every respect the aristocracy of the stateless people, and the Armenians, who were assimilated to the Russian status, were ever officially recognized as “stateless,” placed under the protection of the League of Nations’ Nansen Office, and given traveling papers.

[back]

31. Childs,

op. cit.

The reason for this desperate attempt at promptness was the fear of all governments that even the smallest positive gesture “might encourage countries to get rid of their unwanted people and that many might emigrate who would otherwise remain in their countries even under serious disabilities” (Louise W. Holborn, “The Legal Status of Political Refugees, 1920–38,” in

American Journal of International Law,

1938).

See also Georges Mauco (in

Esprit,

7e année, No. 82, July, 1939, p. 590): “An assimilation of the German refugees to the status of other refugees who were taken care of by the Nansen office would naturally have been the simplest and best solution for the German refugees themselves. But **the governments did not want to extend the privileges already granted to a new category of refugees who, moreover, threatened to increase their number indefinitely**.”

[back]

32. To the 600,000 Jews in Germany and Austria who were potentially stateless in 1938, must be added the Jews of Rumania (the president of the Rumanian Federal Commission for Minorities, Professor Dragomir, having just announced to the world the impending revision of the citizenship of all Rumanian Jews) and Poland (whose foreign minister Beck had officially declared that Poland had one million Jews too many). See Simpson,

op. cit.,

p. 235.

[back]

33. It is difficult to decide what came first, the nation-states’ reluctance to naturalize refugees (the practice of naturalization became increasingly restricted and the practice of denaturalization increasingly common with the arrival of refugees) or the refugees’ reluctance to accept another citizenship. In countries with minority populations like Poland, the refugees (Russians and Ukrainians) had a definite tendency to assimilate to the minorities without however demanding Polish citizenship. (See Simpson,

op. cit.

, p. 364.)

The behavior of Russian refugees is quite characteristic. The Nansen passport described its bearer as “

personne d’origine russe

,” because “**one would not have dared to tell the Russian émigré that he was without nationality or of doubtful nationality**.” (See Marc Vichniac, “Le Statut International des Apatrides,” in

Recueil des Cours de l’Académie de Droit International

, Vol. XXXIII, 1933.) An attempt to provide all stateless persons with uniform identity cards was bitterly contested by the holders of Nansen passports, who claimed that their passport was “a sign of legal recognition of their peculiar status.” (See Jermings,

op. cit.

) Before the outbreak of the war even refugees from Germany were far from eager to be merged with the mass of the stateless, but preferred the description “

réfugié provenant d’Allemagne

” with its remnant of nationality.

More convincing than the complaints of European countries about the difficulties of assimilating refugees are statements from overseas which agree with the former that “of all classes of European immigrants the least easy to assimilate are the South, Eastern, and Central Europeans.” (See “Canada and the Doctrine of Peaceful Changes,” edited by H. F. Angus in

International Studies Conference: Demographic Questions: Peaceful Changes

, 1937, pp. 75–76.)

### Excerpt 8: Better Angels of Our Nature  Why Violence Has Declined, The   Steven Pinker

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Pinker's taxonomy of dehumanizing metaphors—vermin, parasites, contamination—exposes the cognitive machinery that enables expendability at its most extreme: the same disgust-driven logic that fuels genocide operates in attenuated form whenever racialized populations are cast as criminal threats to be contained, surveilled, and purged from the social body.

> The essentialist notion of “bad blood” is one of several biological metaphors inspired by a fear of the revenge of the cradle. People anticipate that if they leave even a few of a defeated enemy alive, the remnants will multiply and cause trouble down the line. Human cognition often works by analogy, and the concept of an irksome collection of procreating beings repeatedly calls to mind the concept of vermin.

105

Perpetrators of genocide the world over keep rediscovering the same metaphors to the point of cliché. **Despised people are rats, snakes, maggots, lice, flies, parasites, cockroaches**, or (in parts of the world where they are pests) monkeys, baboons, and dogs.

106

“Kill the nits and you will have no lice,” wrote an English commander in Ireland in 1641, justifying an order to kill thousands of Irish Catholics.

107

“A nit would make a louse,” recalled a Californian settler leader in 1856 before slaying 240 Yuki in revenge for their killing of a horse.

108

“Nits make lice,” said Colonel John Chivington before the Sand Creek Massacre, which killed hundreds of Cheyenne and Arapaho in 1864.

109

Cankers, cancers, bacilli, and viruses are other insidious biological agents that lend themselves as figures of speech in the poetics of  genocide. When it came to the Jews, Hitler mixed his metaphors, but they were always biological: Jews were viruses; Jews were bloodsucking parasites; Jews were a mongrel race; Jews had poisonous blood.

110

**The human mind has evolved a defense against contamination by biological agents: the emotion of disgust**.

111

Ordinarily triggered by bodily secretions, animal parts, parasitic insects and worms, and vectors of disease, disgust impels people to eject the polluting substance and anything that looks like it or has been in contact with it. Disgust is easily moralized, defining a continuum in which one pole is identified with spirituality, purity, chastity, and cleansing and the other with animality, defilement, carnality, and contamination.

112

And so we see disgusting agents as not just physically repellent but also morally contemptible. Many metaphors in the English language for a treacherous person use a disease vector as their vehicle—

a rat, a louse, a worm, a cockroach.

The infamous 1990s term for forced displacement and genocide was

ethnic cleansing

.

Metaphorical thinking goes in both directions. Not only do we apply disgust metaphors to morally devalued peoples, but we tend to morally devalue people who are physically disgusting (a phenomenon we encountered in chapter 4 when considering Lynn Hunt’s theory that a rise in hygiene in Europe caused a decline in cruel punishments). At one pole of the continuum, whiteclad ascetics who undergo rituals of purification are revered as holy men and women. At the other, **people living in degradation and filth are reviled as subhuman**. The chemist and writer Primo Levi described this spiral during the transport of Jews to the death camps in Germany:

The SS escort did not hide their amusement at the sight of men and women squatting wherever they could, on the platforms and in the middle of the tracks, and the German passengers openly expressed their disgust: people like this deserve their fate, just look how they behave. These are not

Menschen

, human beings, but animals, it’s clear as the light of day.

113

The emotional pathways to genocide—anger, fear, and disgust—can occur in various combinations. In

Worse than War

, a history of 20th-century genocide, the political scientist Daniel Goldhagen points out that not all genocides have the same causes. He classifies them according to whether the victim group is

dehumanized

(a target of moralized disgust),

### Excerpt 9: Les Miserables   Victor Hugo, Isabel F. Hapgood

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Hugo's depiction of Valjean's transformation from a man with a name into a number—imprisoned for stealing bread to feed children—establishes the literary-historical archetype of legal systems manufacturing expendable lives from poverty, a template that Wright, Alexander, and Arendt each reveal operating through the specific machinery of race.

> through a hole made by a blow from a fist, through the grating and the

glass. The arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off. Isabeau ran

out in haste; the robber fled at the full speed of his legs. Isabeau ran

after him and stopped him. The thief had flung away the loaf, but his

arm was still bleeding. It was Jean Valjean.

This took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals

of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at

night. He had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world,

he was a bit of a poacher, and this injured his case. There exists a

legitimate prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the smuggler,

smacks too strongly of the brigand. Nevertheless, we will remark

cursorily, there is still an abyss between these races of men and the

hideous assassin of the towns. The poacher lives in the forest, the

smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea. The cities make ferocious

men because they make corrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the forest,

make savage men; they develop the fierce side, but often without

destroying the humane side.

Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty. The terms of the Code were explicit.

There occur formidable hours in our civilization; there are moments when

the penal laws decree a shipwreck. What an ominous minute is that in

which society draws back and consummates the irreparable abandonment

of a sentient being! Jean Valjean was condemned to five years in the

galleys.

On the 22d of April, 1796, the victory of Montenotte, won by the

general-in-chief of the army of Italy, whom the message of the Directory

to the Five Hundred, of the 2d of Floreal, year IV., calls Buona-Parte,

was announced in Paris; on that same day a great gang of galley-slaves

was put in chains at Bicetre. Jean Valjean formed a part of that gang.

An old turnkey of the prison, who is now nearly eighty years old, still

recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of

the fourth line, in the north angle of the courtyard. He was seated on

the ground like the others. He did not seem to comprehend his position,

except that it was horrible. It is probable that he, also, was

disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man, ignorant of

everything, something excessive. While the bolt of his iron collar was

being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer, he wept,

his tears stifled him, they impeded his speech; he only managed to

say from time to time, "I was a tree-pruner at Faverolles." Then still

sobbing, he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times,

as though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights,

and from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done,

whatever it was, he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing

seven little children.

He set out for Toulon. He arrived there, after a journey of twenty-seven

days, on a cart, with a chain on his neck. At Toulon he was clothed in

the red cassock. All that had constituted his life, even to his name,

was effaced; **he was no longer even Jean Valjean; he was number 24,601**.

What became of his sister? What became of the seven children? Who

troubled himself about that? What becomes of the handful of leaves from

the young tree which is sawed off at the root?

### Excerpt 10: Behave  The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst   Robert M. Sapolsky

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Sapolsky's call to abandon the moral framework of deserved punishment poses the trail's ultimate question: if expendability is manufactured by legal architecture, racial psychology, and dehumanizing narrative rather than by individual evil, then dismantling it requires not just policy reform but a fundamental shift in how we understand human agency—the same shift Wright demanded when he insisted America see Bigger Thomas as its own creation.

> Which brings us to the huge practical challenge. The traditional rationales behind imprisonment are to protect the public, to rehabilitate, to

punish, and finally to use the threat of punishment to deter others. That last one is the practical challenge, because such threats of punishment can indeed deter. How can that be done? The broadest type of solution is incompatible with an open society—making the public

believe

that imprisonment involves horrific punishments when, in reality, it doesn’t. Perhaps the loss of freedom that occurs when a dangerous person is removed from society must be deterrence enough. Perhaps some conventional punishment will still be needed if it is sufficiently deterring. But **what must be abolished are the views that punishment can be deserved and that punishing can be virtuous**.

None of this will be easy. When contemplating the challenge to do so, it is important to remember that some, many, maybe even most of the people who were prosecuting epileptics in the fifteenth century were no different from us—sincere, cautious, and ethical, concerned about the serious problems threatening their society, hoping to bequeath their children a safer world. Just operating with an unrecognizably different mind-set. The psychological distance from them to us is vast, separated by the yawning chasm that was the discovery of “It’s not her, it’s her disease.” Having crossed that divide, the distance we now need to go is far shorter—it merely consists of taking that same insight and being willing to see its valid extension in whatever directions science takes us.

The hope is that when it comes to dealing with humans whose behaviors are among our worst and most damaging, words like “evil” and “soul” will be as irrelevant as when considering a car with faulty brakes, that they will be as rarely spoken in a courtroom as in an auto repair shop. And crucially, the analogy holds in a key way, extending to instances of dangerous people without anything obviously wrong with their frontal cortex, genes, and so on. When a car is being dysfunctional and dangerous and we take it to a mechanic, this is not a dualistic situation where (a) if the mechanic discovers some broken widget causing the problem, we have a mechanistic explanation, but (b) if the mechanic can’t find anything wrong, we’re dealing with an evil car; sure, the mechanic can speculate on the source of the problem—maybe it’s the blueprint from which the car was built, maybe it was the building process, maybe the environment

contains some unknown pollutant that somehow impairs function, maybe someday we’ll have sufficiently powerful techniques in the auto shop to spot some key molecule in the engine that is out of whack—but in the meantime we’ll consider this car to be evil. Car free will also equals “internal forces we do not understand yet.”

Many who are viscerally opposed to this view charge that it is dehumanizing to frame damaged humans as broken machines. But as a final, crucial point, **doing that is a hell of a lot more humane than demonizing and sermonizing them as sinners**.
