# The Ledger at Dusk: Power Weighed by Dying Hands

**Description**: Emperors, generals, and statesmen reviewing the true cost of their life's work as mortality closes in — Marcus Aurelius in his tent, Augustus surveying his Rome, Grant writing through cancer, and Seneca composing his final letters.

**Rationale**: By reading these figures' late-life reckonings side by side, we see how the architecture of power looks from inside its ruins — and whether any of them found the sum worth the price.

## Trail Excerpts

### Excerpt 1: Augustus   John Williams

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Augustus opens the trail's central ledger: he has outlived every friend who gave his life meaning, and discovers that the emperor who endures longest pays the highest price — the slow revelation that power sustained past its purpose becomes indistinguishable from emptiness.

> Six times during my life has this tomb of my soul led me to the brink of that eternal darkness into which all men sink at last, and six times it has stepped back, as if at the behest of a destiny it could not overmaster. And I have long outlived my friends, in whose lives I existed more fully than in my own. All are dead, those early friends. Julius Caesar died at fifty-eight, nearly twenty years younger than I am now; and I have always believed that his death came as much from that boredom which presages carelessness as from the assassins’ daggers. Salvidienus Rufus died at the age of twenty-three, in his pride and by his own hand, because he thought he had betrayed our friendship. Poor Salvidienus. Of all my early friends, he was most like me. I wonder if he ever knew that the betrayal was my own, that he was the innocent victim of an infection that he caught from me. Vergil died at fifty-one, and I was at his bedside; in his delirium, he thought he died a failure, and made me promise to destroy his great poem on the founding of Rome. And then Marcus Agrippa, at the age of fifty, who had never had a day of illness in his life, died suddenly, at the height of his powers, before I could reach him to bid him farewell. And a few years later—in my memory, the years dissolve into one another, like the notes of tambour and lute and trumpet, to make a single sound—within a month of each other, Maecenas and Horace were dead. Except for you, my dear Nicolaus, they were the last of my old friends.

It seems to me now, as my own life is slowly trickling away, that there was a kind of symmetry in their lives that my own has not had. My friends died at the height of their powers, when they had accomplished their work and yet had further triumphs to look forward to; nor were they so unfortunate to come to believe that their lives had been lived for nothing. **For nearly twenty years, it seems to me now, my life has been lived for nothing**. Alexander was fortunate to have died so young, else he would have come to know that **if to conquer a world is a small thing, to rule it is even less**.

As you know, both my admirers and detractors have likened me to that ambitious young Macedonian; it is true that the Roman Empire is now constituted of many of the lands that Alexander first conquered, it is true that like him I came to my power as a young man, and it is true that I have traveled in many of the lands that he first subjugated to his rather barbaric will. But I have never wished to conquer the world, and I have been more nearly ruled than ruler.

### Excerpt 2: Augustus   John Williams

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Julia's memory reveals the private grief hidden beneath imperial ceremony — a fleeting moment of selfhood interrupted by duty's summons, arriving too late. The sensory echo of truffles and black bread collapses decades into a single taste, showing how the dying mind audits not conquests but the small, irreversible failures of presence.

> I sat upon the chair, and saw them beneath me; a breeze came up, and I could hear it rustle among the cypresses and plane trees as it touched my silken tunic like a caress. The dancers danced, and the oiled flesh of the men rippled in the torchlight; and I remembered Ilium and Lesbos, where once I had been more than a mortal. Sempronius reclined beside my throne, on the grass; and **for a moment I was as happy as I had been, and was myself**.

But in this happiness, I became aware of someone standing beside me, bowing, attempting to get my attention; I recognized him as a servant from my father’s household, and motioned for him to wait until the dance was over.

When the dancers had finished, and after the languorous applause of the guests, I allowed the servant to approach me.

“What does my father require of me?” I asked him.

“I am Priscus,” he said. “It is your husband. He is ill. Your father leaves within the hour for Puteoli, and asks you to follow.”

“Is it a serious matter, do you think?”

Priscus nodded. “Your father leaves this night. He is concerned.”

I turned away from him, and looked at my friends who lounged in their ease and gaiety on the grassy slopes of Sempronius Gracchus’s garden. The sound of their laughter, more charming and delicate than the music that had moved the dancers, floated up to me on the warm spring breeze. I said to Priscus:

“Return to my father. Tell him that I shall join my husband. Tell him not to wait for me. Tell him that I will leave here shortly, and will join my husband by my own means.”

Priscus hesitated. I said:

“You may speak.”

“Your father wishes you to return with me.”

“Tell my father that I have always done my duty to my husband. I cannot leave now. I will see my husband later.”

Priscus left then, and I started to speak to Sempronius Gracchus about the news I had received; but Ovid had taken his place before me, and had begun to speak the poem that he had written in my honor; I could not interrupt him.

At one time I knew that poem by memory; now I cannot recall a word of it. It is strange that I cannot, for it was a remarkable poem. I believe he never included it in one of his books; he said that it was my own, and should belong to no one else.

**I did not see my husband again**. He was dead by the time my father reached Puteoli; the illness, which the doctors never really discovered, was rapid and, I hope, merciful. He was a good man, and kind to me; I’m afraid he never realized I knew that. And I believe my father never forgave me for not joining him that night.

. . . It was the truffles. We had a delicacy of truffles that evening at the villa of Sempronius Gracchus. **The earthy taste of those truffles was brought back by the earthy taste of this black bread**, and that reminded me of the evening when I became a widow for the second time.

V. Poem to Julia: Attributed to Ovid

(circa

13 B.C.

)

Restless, and wandering aimlessly, I pass temples and groves where Gods live—Gods who invite passers to worship as they

Pause in the ancient groves where no ax has, in our memory’s Mortal endurance, bit hungrily branches or shrubs.

### Excerpt 3: The Iliad   Homer

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Achilles articulates the original terms of the ledger that every figure on this trail must settle: fame or life, renown or years. His rejection of Agamemnon's bribes establishes the ancient insight that no treasury of spoils can purchase back a single day — the same arithmetic Augustus, Grant, and Johnson each recalculate on their deathbeds.

> To-morrow we the favouring gods implore;

Then shall you see our parting vessels crown’d,

And hear with oars the Hellespont resound.

The third day hence shall Pythia greet our sails,

[208]

If mighty Neptune send propitious gales;

Pythia to her Achilles shall restore

The wealth he left for this detested shore:

Thither the spoils of this long war shall pass,

The ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass:

My beauteous captives thither I’ll convey,

And all that rests of my unravish’d prey.

One only valued gift your tyrant gave,

And that resumed—the fair Lyrnessian slave.

Then tell him: loud, that all the Greeks may hear,

And learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear;

(For arm’d in impudence, mankind he braves,

And meditates new cheats on all his slaves;

Though shameless as he is, to face these eyes

Is what he dares not: if he dares he dies;)

Tell him, all terms, all commerce I decline,

Nor share his council, nor his battle join;

For once deceiv’d, was his; but twice were mine,

No—let the stupid prince, whom Jove deprives

Of sense and justice, run where frenzy drives;

His gifts are hateful: kings of such a kind

Stand but as slaves before a noble mind,

Not though he proffer’d all himself possess’d,

And all his rapine could from others wrest:

Not all the golden tides of wealth that crown

The many-peopled Orchomenian town;

[209]

Not all proud Thebes’ unrivall’d walls contain,

The world’s great empress on the Egyptian plain

(That spreads her conquests o’er a thousand states,

And pours her heroes through a hundred gates,

Two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars

From each wide portal issuing to the wars);

[210]

Though bribes were heap’d on bribes, in number more

Than dust in fields, or sands along the shore;

Should all these offers for my friendship call,

’Tis he that offers, and I scorn them all.

Atrides’ daughter never shall be led

(An ill-match’d consort) to Achilles’ bed;

Like golden Venus though she charm’d the heart,

And vied with Pallas in the works of art;

Some greater Greek let those high nuptials grace,

I hate alliance with a tyrant’s race.

If heaven restore me to my realms with life,

The reverend Peleus shall elect my wife;

Thessalian nymphs there are of form divine,

And kings that sue to mix their blood with mine.

Bless’d in kind love, my years shall glide away,

Content with just hereditary sway;

There, deaf for ever to the martial strife,

Enjoy the dear prerogative of life.

**Life is not to be bought with heaps of gold**.

Not all Apollo’s Pythian treasures hold,

Or Troy once held, in peace and pride of sway,

Can bribe the poor possession of a day!

Lost herds and treasures we by arms regain,

And steeds unrivall’d on the dusty plain:

But from our lips the vital spirit fled,

Returns no more to wake the silent dead.

My fates long since by Thetis were disclosed,

And each alternate, life or fame, proposed;

Here, if I stay, before the Trojan town,

Short is my date, but deathless my renown:

If I return, I quit immortal praise

For years on years, and long-extended days.

Convinced, though late, I find my fond mistake,

And warn the Greeks the wiser choice to make;

To quit these shores, their native seats enjoy,

Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.

Jove’s arm display’d asserts her from the skies!

Her hearts are strengthen’d, and her glories rise.

Go then to Greece, report our fix’d design;

Bid all your counsels, all your armies join,

### Excerpt 4: Grant   Ron Chernow

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Grant's final campaign is waged with pen and paper — a letter securing a grandson's future, a dictated message of gratitude extended even to former enemies. The general who once commanded armies now commands only his own dying, and the hush that falls as he folds the document is the silence of power transferring itself from sword to testament.

> Around this time he performed a ceremony that he had contemplated for some time. He asked Fred to compose a letter requesting a future president of the United States to appoint his grandson Ulysses (Fred’s son) as a West Point cadet. Grant summoned family members and doctors as witnesses before he affixed his signature to the document. **It was such a solemn gesture for him that as he folded the paper, a hush gripped the room**. In 1898 President William McKinley would honor the request by appointing Ulysses S. Grant III, later a major general, to the academy.

Easter Day that year dawned bright and clear, and large crowds promenaded

along Fifth Avenue, many pausing at the corner of East Sixty-Sixth Street to gaze concernedly at Grant’s town house. From the bay window, Dr. Shrady observed the swelling crowd mingling on the sidewalk below. The scene abounded with reporters, but ordinary citizens also gathered there, often weeping. Grant took his cane, shuffled to the window, and, screened by curtains, pondered the multitude. “I am very grateful to them,” he told the doctor, who suggested, “Why not tell them so, General?”

62

Shrady pointed out that newspaper readers might appreciate a direct message from him. “Very well,” said Grant. As Shrady grabbed a yellow paper, Grant dictated: “General Grant wishes it stated that he is very much touched by, and very grateful for, the sympathy and interest manifested for him by his friends and by those”—here he momentarily wavered—“who have not been regarded as such.”

63

Adam Badeau cheered, “Splendid! Splendid! Stop right there, General Grant! I would not say another word.” After minor edits, the statement went out to newspapers across America.

As cancerous sores spread in Grant’s mouth, Dr. Shrady studied his courteous, gentlemanly patient, the “far-off look” in his eyes and his meditative mood.

64

“He had the gentlest disposition, like that of an unspoiled young girl.”

65

Shrady said Grant knew his disease was terminal and that he could only look forward to more grisly pain. Nonetheless, he discussed his symptoms clinically, even taking his own pulse, a scientific detachment that had served him well in battle. “**Brave though he had been on the battlefield, his courage in facing death from an incurable disease was not only a revelation but an inspiration**,” Shrady wrote.

66

A couple of days after Easter, Grant was “seized with a severe fit of coughing . . . followed by a hemorrhage of arterial blood,” reported one newspaper, which didn’t think he would survive the night.

67

Grant awoke to a telegram from Queen Victoria, inquiring anxiously after his health, followed two weeks later by one from Prime Minister William Gladstone. As Grant approached the twentieth anniversary of Appomattox, he suffered no illusions. “My chances, I think, of pulling through this are one in a hundred.”

68

Privately, Fred Dent sounded even more dubious, writing that his brother-in-law was “going to die soon unless a miracle saves him.”

69

Neither morbid nor mournful, Grant faced his mortality in clear-eyed fashion and his sensible nature never deserted him. A lifelong Methodist, he had always viewed religious excess with a certain irony, having once told a clutch of ministers that America boasted three parties: Democrats, Republicans, and Methodists. The Reverend John P. Newman now became a familiar face at East

Sixty-Sixth Street. When he led the family in evening prayers, Grant found the experience a bit trying. Fred said his father was a good Christian but “

not

### Excerpt 5: Leadership   Doris Kearns Goodwin

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Johnson's vulnerability before a young historian reveals the compulsion that drives every figure on this trail: the need to shape the ledger's final entry before the pen is taken away. His insistence on driving himself through ice to a civil rights symposium is the statesman's version of Grant writing through cancer — the dying body overruled by the unfinished account.

> Returning that night to my room at the ranch, making notes on what he had said, I asked myself a question I would ask many times in the years to follow: Why was he telling me all these things? Why was he allowing me to see his vulnerability and sorrow? Perhaps it was because I was a

young woman and aspired to become a historian, two constituencies he badly wanted to reach, to persuade, to shape, and to inspire. Perhaps, to a lesser extent, it was because I possessed an Ivy League pedigree, which he both held in contempt and coveted. Or maybe it was simply that I listened with sleepless intensity as he strove to come to terms with the meaning of his life.

For the more we talked, the more it seemed to me that **he believed his life was drawing to a close**. Indeed, I later found out that he had commissioned an actuarial table while still in the presidency which statistically predicted, based on his family history of heart failure, that he would likely die at sixty-four. Only a little more than a year into his retirement, in the spring of 1970, severe chest pains sent him to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, where he was diagnosed with angina. He embarked on a strict regime of diet and exercise, but it was not long before he resumed eating rich foods, drinking Cutty Sark scotch, and chain-smoking. “

I’m an old man so what’s the difference?” he said. “I don’t want to linger the way Eisenhower did. When I go, I want to go fast.”

In April 1972, Johnson suffered a massive heart attack while staying at the Virginia home of his daughter Lynda. Against doctor’s orders, he insisted on returning to Texas to recuperate. Reprising his father’s dying wish, he wanted to return to a place where “

people know when you’re sick and care when you die.” Though he managed to survive his second heart attack, his remaining time was filled with pain. “

I’m hurting real bad,” he told friends. Mornings would begin fairly well, but by afternoon, he often experienced “a series of sharp, jolting pains in the chest that left him scared and breathless.” A portable oxygen tank beside his bed provided only temporary relief.

Nine months later, on December 11, 1972, Johnson was scheduled to speak at a civil rights symposium at the LBJ Library. All the leaders of the civil rights community would be present: Roy Wilkins, Clarence Mitchell, Hubert Humphrey, Julian Bond, Barbara Jordan, Vernon Jordan, former chief justice Earl Warren, among many others. On the Sunday night before the symposium’s opening, however, a treacherous ice storm had descended on Austin. It was unclear if the event would even proceed. “

So cold and icy was it,” library director Harry Middleton recalled, “that we got word that the plane carrying many of the participants from Washington couldn’t land at the Austin airport, and they would have to come here by bus.”

“

Lyndon had been quite sick the night before and up most of the night,” Lady Bird remembered. “The doctor insisted that he absolutely,

positively could not go.” Nevertheless, wearing “

a dark-blue presidential suit” and “flawlessly polished oxfords,” he headed out over the icy roads on the seventy-mile trek to Austin. Though he had given up driving in recent months, he became so agitated by the driver’s slow pace that he took the wheel himself.

### Excerpt 6: Fifty Famous Stories Retold   James Baldwin

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: William the Conqueror's deathbed division of his kingdom distills the trail's anxiety to its simplest fable: the ruler who carved an empire by force discovers that his final act of power is merely a guess — a wager on sons he cannot control, proving that dominion ends exactly where the dying hand releases its grip.

> William lay upon his death-bed, and again he thought of what would

become of his sons when he was gone. Then he re-mem-bered what the

wise men had told him; and so he de-clared that Robert should have the

lands which he held in France, that William should be the King

of

England, and that Henry should have no land at all, but only a chest

of gold.

So it hap-pened in the end very much as the wise men had fore-told.

Robert, the Short Stocking, was bold and reckless, like the hawk which

he so much admired. He lost all the lands that his father had left

him, and was at last shut up in prison, where he was kept until he

died.

William Rufus was so over-bear-ing and cruel that he was feared and

hated by all his people. He led a wicked life, and was killed by one

of his own men while hunting in the forest.

And Henry, the Handsome Scholar, had not only the chest of gold for

his own, but he became by and by the King of England and the ruler of

all the lands that his father had had in France.

THE WHITE SHIP.

King Henry, the Handsome Scholar, had one son, named William, whom he

dearly loved. The young man was noble and brave, and every-body hoped

that he would some day be the King of England.

One summer Prince William went with his father across the sea to look

after their lands in France.

They were wel-comed with joy by all

their people there, and the young prince was so gallant and kind, that

he won the love of all who saw him.

But at last the time came for them to go back to England. The king,

with his wise men and brave knights, set sail early in the day; but

Prince William with his younger friends waited a little while. They

had had so joyous a time in France that they were in no great haste to

tear them-selves away.

Then they went on board of the ship which was waiting to carry them

home. It was a beau-ti-ful ship with white sails and white masts, and

it had been fitted up on purpose for this voyage.

The sea was smooth, the winds were fair, and no one thought of danger.

On the ship, every-thing had been ar-ranged to make the trip a

pleasant one. There was music and dancing, and everybody was merry and

glad.

The sun had gone down before the white-winged vessel was fairly out of

the bay. But what of that? The moon was at its full, and it would give

light enough; and before the dawn of the morrow, the narrow sea would

be crossed. And so the prince, and the young people who were with him,

gave themselves up to mer-ri-ment and feasting and joy.

The ear-li-er hours of the night passed by; and

then there was a cry

of alarm on deck. A moment after-ward there was a great crash. The

ship had struck upon a rock. The water rushed in. She was sinking. Ah,

where now were those who had lately been so heart-free and glad?

Every heart was full of fear. No one knew what to do. A small boat was

quickly launched, and the prince with a few of his bravest friends

leaped into it. They pushed off just as the ship was be-gin-ning to

settle beneath the waves. Would they be saved?

They had rowed hardly ten yards from the ship, when there was a cry

### Excerpt 7: Alexander Hamilton   Ron Chernow

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Hamilton's death suspends the commerce of the city he built, turning an entire metropolis into a deathbed vigil. His repeated refrain to Eliza — 'Remember, you are a Christian' — is the statesman's last attempt to balance the ledger not with policy but with consolation, acknowledging that the only account still open is the one kept by those who loved him.

> Pretty soon, knots of anxious New Yorkers gathered on street

corners to discuss the still fragmentary reports. As the hours passed, the frenetic life of the city that Hamilton had enriched so immeasurably ground to a halt. “This is indeed a sad day,” wrote Hamilton’s associate David Ogden. “**All business seems to be suspended in the city and a solemn gloom hangs on every countenance**.”

48

Throughout the day came bulletins on the dying man’s state, and a mass of people congregated before the Bayard mansion. Some French ships anchored in New York harbor sent surgeons specially trained in treating gunshot wounds to see if they could resuscitate Hamilton.

At first, Hamilton suffered such exquisite pain that Dr. Hosack did not strip off his bloody garments but just plied him with weak wine and water. When Hamilton complained of acute back discomfort, Hosack and other attendants took off his clothes, darkened the room, and began to administer sizable doses of laudanum to dull the ache. Despite the pain, Hamilton reacted to the situation with stoic fortitude and an impressive regard for others, worrying constantly about the plight of Eliza and the children. Following his advice, Eliza had been summoned from the Grange but was told at first only that her husband was suffering from “spasms.” Initially she trusted this fiction, Oliver Wolcott, Jr., wrote, and nobody dared to tell her the truth because it was “feared she would become frantic.”

49

The concern for Eliza’s mental health was not misplaced. When she discovered the horrid truth, she grew “half-distracted” and gave way to “frantic grief,” said Hosack.

50

To comfort her, Hamilton kept intoning the one refrain he knew would soothe her troubled spirit above all others: “

**Remember, my Eliza, you are a Christian**.

”

51

For those packed into the Bayard household, the scene of grief was unbearable. David Ogden watched as Eliza sat devotedly at her husband’s bedside, fanning his feverish face. Ogden wrote a friend that “it is but two years since her eldest son was killed in the same manner. Gracious God! What must be her feelings?”

52

Angelica Church hastened to succor the man who had been her obsession for so many years. Gouverneur Morris would remember an inconsolable Angelica “

weeping her heart out.

”

53

She expressed her profound admiration for Eliza in the face of such intolerable adversity. “My dear sister bears with saintlike fortitude this affliction,” she told their brother Philip.

54

Aside from his strongly protective feelings toward his family, Hamilton was preoccupied with spiritual matters in a way that eliminates all doubt about the sincerity of his late-flowering religious interests. It is not certain that Hamilton was as eloquent on his deathbed as his friends later attested, but their accounts corroborate one another and are remarkably consistent. No sooner was he brought to the Bayard house than he made it a matter of urgent concern to receive last rites from the Episcopal Church. He asked to see the Reverend Benjamin Moore, who was the rector of Trinity Church, the Episcopal bishop of New York, and the president of

Columbia College. The eminent Moore balked at giving Hamilton holy communion as he wrestled with two nagging reservations. He thought dueling an impious practice and did not wish to sanction the confrontation with Burr. He also knew that Hamilton had not been a regular churchgoer. As a result, Bishop Moore could not, in good conscience, comply with Hamilton’s wishes.

### Excerpt 8: A Christmas Carol   Charles Dickens

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Dickens stages the trail's nightmare inversion: a life whose ledger shows only accumulation and isolation, its final audit conducted by scavengers. The contrast between the plundered miser and the beloved dead — whose good deeds spring from the wound — frames the moral question haunting every emperor and general on this trail: which body will yours resemble at the end?

> itself.

“Ha, ha!” laughed the same woman, when old Joe, producing a

flannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the

ground. “This is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one

away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha,

ha!”

“Spirit!” said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot.

“I see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My

life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is this!”

He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now he almost

touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which, beneath a ragged

sheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb,

announced itself in awful language.

The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy,

though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse,

anxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the

outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft,

unwatched, unwept, uncared for, was the body of this man.

Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the

head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of

it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge’s part, would have

disclosed the face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do,

and longed to do it; but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to

dismiss the spectre at his side.

Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and dress

it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command: for this is thy

dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head, thou canst not

turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is

not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released; it is not

that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand

was

open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender; and the

pulse a man’s. Strike, Shadow, strike! And see his good deeds

springing from the wound, to sow the world with life immortal!

No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge’s ears, and yet he

heard them when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be

raised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice,

hard-dealing, griping cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly!

He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child, to

say that he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one

kind word I will be kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and

there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What

they

wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and

disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.

“Spirit!” he said, “this is a fearful place. In

leaving it, I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!”

Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head.

“I understand you,” Scrooge returned, “and I would do

it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have not the power.”

Again it seemed to look upon him.

“If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by

this man’s death,” said Scrooge quite agonised, “show

### Excerpt 9: Heart of Darkness   Joseph Conrad

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Marlow inherits the slim residue of Kurtz's imperial ambition — letters, a portrait, a memory — and must decide what testimony to carry forward from a life consumed by its own reach. Kurtz is the trail's darkest case study: the man of power whose final words become not a legacy but a verdict, and whose ledger can only be closed by a lie told to the living.

> know, he asked, with a sudden flash of curiosity, ‘what it was that had

induced him to go out there?’ ‘Yes,’ said I, and forthwith

handed him the famous Report for publication, if he thought fit. He glanced

through it hurriedly, mumbling all the time, judged ‘it would do,’

and took himself off with this plunder.

“Thus I was left at last with a slim packet of letters and the

girl’s portrait. She struck me as beautiful—I mean she had a

beautiful expression. I know that the sunlight can be made to lie, too, yet one

felt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the delicate

shade of truthfulness upon those features. She seemed ready to listen without

mental reservation, without suspicion, without a thought for herself. I

concluded I would go and give her back her portrait and those letters myself.

Curiosity? Yes; and also some other feeling perhaps. All that had been

Kurtz’s had passed out of my hands: his soul, his body, his station, his

plans, his ivory, his career. There remained only his memory and his

Intended—and I wanted to give that up, too, to the past, in a

way—to surrender personally all that remained of him with me to that

oblivion which is the last word of our common fate. I don’t defend

myself. I had no clear perception of what it was I really wanted. Perhaps it

was an impulse of unconscious loyalty, or the fulfilment of one of those ironic

necessities that lurk in the facts of human existence. I don’t know. I

can’t tell. But I went.

“I thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that

accumulate in every man’s life—a vague impress on the brain of

shadows that had fallen on it in their swift and final passage; but before the

high and ponderous door, between the tall houses of a street as still and

decorous as a well-kept alley in a cemetery, I had a vision of him on the

stretcher, opening his mouth voraciously, as if to devour all the earth with

all its mankind. He lived then before me; he lived as much as he had ever

lived—a shadow insatiable of splendid appearances, of frightful

realities; a shadow darker than the shadow of the night, and draped nobly in

the folds of a gorgeous eloquence. The vision seemed to enter the house with

me—the stretcher, the phantom-bearers, the wild crowd of obedient

worshippers, the gloom of the forests, the glitter of the reach between the

murky bends, the beat of the drum, regular and muffled like the beating of a

heart—**the heart of a conquering darkness**. It was a moment of triumph for

the wilderness, an invading and vengeful rush which, it seemed to me, I would

have to keep back alone for the salvation of another soul. And the memory of

what I had heard him say afar there, with the horned shapes stirring at my

back, in the glow of fires, within the patient woods, those broken phrases came

back to me, were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity. I

remembered his abject pleading, his abject threats, the colossal scale of his

vile desires, the meanness, the torment, the tempestuous anguish of his soul.

And later on I seemed to see his collected languid manner, when he said one

day, ‘This lot of ivory now is really mine. The Company did not pay for

it. I collected it myself at a very great personal risk. I am afraid they will

### Excerpt 10: Count of Monte Cristo, The   Alexandre Dumas

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Monte Cristo's will-writing closes the trail where it began — with a powerful man alone at a desk, trying to convert a lifetime of calculated vengeance into a document that outlasts him. Haidée's act of tearing the will apart insists that love refuses the ledger's terms entirely, and his whispered recognition — 'I might have been happy yet' — is the confession every figure on this trail approaches but few dare to speak aloud.

> palaces and houses, and which without the twenty millions

and the legacies to my servants, may still amount to sixty

millions."

He was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made

him start, and the pen fell from his hand. "Haidee," said

he, "did you read it?"

"Oh, my lord," said she, "why are you writing thus at such

an hour? Why are you bequeathing all your fortune to me? Are

you going to leave me?"

"I am going on a journey, dear child," said Monte Cristo,

with an expression of infinite tenderness and melancholy;

"and if any misfortune should happen to me"

The count stopped. "Well?" asked the young girl, with an

authoritative tone the count had never observed before, and

which startled him. "Well, if any misfortune happen to me,"

replied Monte Cristo, "I wish my daughter to be happy."

Haidee smiled sorrowfully, and shook her head. "Do you think

of dying, my lord?" said she.

"The wise man, my child, has said, `It is good to think of

death.'"

"Well, if you die," said she, "bequeath your fortune to

others, for **if you die I shall require nothing**;" and, taking

the paper, she tore it in four pieces, and threw it into the

middle of the room. Then, the effort having exhausted her

strength, she fell not asleep this time, but fainting on the

floor. The count leaned over her and raised her in his arms;

and seeing that sweet pale face, those lovely eyes closed,

that beautiful form motionless and to all appearance

lifeless, the idea occurred to him for the first time, that

perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a

father.

"Alas," murmured he, with intense suffering, "I might, then,

have been happy yet." Then he carried Haidee to her room,

resigned her to the care of her attendants, and returning to

his study, which he shut quickly this time, he again copied

the destroyed will. As he was finishing, the sound of a

cabriolet entering the yard was heard. Monte Cristo

approached the window, and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel

alight. "Good," said he; "it was time," — and he sealed his

will with three seals. A moment afterwards he heard a noise

in the drawing-room, and went to open the door himself.

Morrel was there; he had come twenty minutes before the time

appointed. "I am perhaps come too soon, count," said he,

"but I frankly acknowledge that I have not closed my eyes

all night, nor has any one in my house. I need to see you

strong in your courageous assurance, to recover myself."

Monte Cristo could not resist this proof of affection; he

not only extended his hand to the young man, but flew to him

with open arms. "Morrel," said he, "it is a happy day for

me, to feel that I am beloved by such a man as you.

Good-morning, Emmanuel; you will come with me then,

Maximilian?"

"Did you doubt it?" said the young captain.

"But if I were wrong" —

"I watched you during the whole scene of that challenge

yesterday; I have been thinking of your firmness all night,

and I said to myself that justice must be on your side, or

man's countenance is no longer to be relied on."

"But, Morrel, Albert is your friend?"

"Simply an acquaintance, sir."

"You met on the same day you first saw me?"

"Yes, that is true; but I should not have recollected it if

you had not reminded me."

"Thank you, Morrel." Then ringing the bell once, "Look."
