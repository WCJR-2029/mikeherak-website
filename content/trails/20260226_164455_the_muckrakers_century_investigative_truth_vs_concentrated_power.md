# The Muckraker's Century: Investigative Truth vs. Concentrated Power

**Description**: Traces the recurring confrontation between investigative journalism and monopolistic corporate power from Rockefeller's Standard Oil through Bezos's Amazon to Elizabeth Holmes's Theranos, revealing the unchanging anatomy of exposure.

**Rationale**: Across Titan, Bully Pulpit, Bad Blood, Everything Store, and Manufacturing Consent, the same drama replays — a lone reporter or whistleblower confronts a fortress of corporate secrecy — and the structural dynamics of that confrontation have barely changed in 120 years.

### Trail Synthesis

The story that runs through this trail is not really about journalism — it is about what happens when the gap between private reality and public myth becomes too large to sustain. Ida Tarbell did not go after Standard Oil because she was an idealist; she went because she had watched Rockefeller's secret railroad rebates destroy her father's livelihood, and she could not unknow what she had seen. That wound produced the investigative temperament: a refusal to accept the official story when private evidence contradicts it. The January 1903 issue of McClure's proved the method — meticulously documented facts, allowed to speak for themselves without preaching — and a fractured public, for the first time, recognized what it had only suspected was true. A century later, John Carreyrou sat in a Brooklyn car, unable to believe that a college dropout with two semesters of chemical engineering had revolutionized blood testing, and followed the same instinct to the gap between claim and evidence.

What the trail makes visible is that concentrated power always tells the same story about itself: that its dominance is efficiency, that critics are malcontents and ingrates, that exposure is persecution by entrenched interests. Rockefeller believed the oil producers whose livelihoods he'd destroyed simply failed to appreciate his superefficient United Pipe Lines system. Holmes appeared on CNBC in her all-black attire and told Jim Cramer that this is what happens when you try to change the world. The counter-move is identical across 120 years: discredit the witnesses, deploy legal coercion, and force the documented truth to outlast the PR offensive. Hamilton provided the constitutional bedrock from the beginning — a free press exists precisely to give early alarm against the encroachments of power, and the truth, he insisted before a hushed courtroom, is not a crime.

## Trail Excerpts

### Excerpt 1: Bully Pulpit, The   Doris Kearns Goodwin

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: The origin story of American muckraking is inseparable from the origin story of American monopoly: Ida Tarbell's childhood witnessing of Rockefeller's secret railroad rebates crushing her father's livelihood forged the investigative temperament—a 'hatred of privilege'—that would define a century of journalism confronting concentrated power.

> “nothing they did not hope and dare.” The triumph of optimism in Titusville was destined to end, however: “Suddenly, at the very heyday of this confidence, **a big hand reached out from nobody knew where, to steal their conquest and throttle their future**.” That mysterious hand belonged to none other than John D. Rockefeller, as Tarbell would boldly elucidate years later in her chronicle of the history of the Standard Oil Company for

McClure’s

magazine—the landmark series that would affirm her reputation as the leading investigative journalist of her day.

At the time, all that Ida’s father and his colleagues knew was that the

railroads arbitrarily doubled their published rates for carrying petroleum—crude and refined—to the east coast, a huge inflation heralding ruin for the entire region. The local oilmen eventually discovered that Rockefeller had forged an alliance between the railroads and a small group of privileged refiners.

His “big scheme” enabled those in the newly formed South Improvement Company to receive secret rebates on every barrel shipped, while outside companies would be charged increased rates to make up for the insiders’ discount. This deal, meant to destroy small competitors, Tarbell later explained,

“**started the Standard Oil Company off on the road to monopoly**.”

The local producers joined together to retaliate.

“There were nightly anti-monopoly meetings,” Ida recalled, “violent speeches, processions; trains of oil cars loaded for members of the offending corporation were raided, the oil run on the ground.” The tensions of these confrontations were reflected in the Tarbell household. Franklin Tarbell no longer entertained his family with “the funny things he had seen and heard during the day” or relaxed with an after-dinner cigar to the music he loved. If the machinations behind

the conflict were

“all pretty hazy” to young Ida, she gleaned enough from her father’s conversation to comprehend that “what had been undertaken was

wrong

.” From that painful, disruptive period, she wrote, “**there was born in me a hatred of privilege**”—in this case, the powerful oilmen preying on the independents, but eventually “privilege of any sort.”

As her father fought against monopoly, her mother struggled with a painful

“readjustment of her status in the home and in society.” Esther Tarbell, Ida later wrote, “had grown up with the Woman’s Rights movement.” She had taught for a dozen years before her marriage and had planned on “seeking a higher education.” Had she remained single, Ida believed, “she would have sought to ‘vindicate her sex.’ . . . The fight would have delighted her.” But after marriage she “found herself a pioneer in the Oil Region, confronted by the sternest of problems,” which compelled the investment of her energies into the well-being of her family. Witnessing her mother’s frustration, Ida determined early on that she

“would never marry.” She was certain that having a husband and children would thwart her freedom and curtail her nascent ambition. At fourteen, she fell to her knees and entreated God to prevent her ever marrying.

Captivated by the natural world, Ida had spent the long afternoons of her childhood wandering around the countryside to gather leaves and plant specimens in her area,

### Excerpt 2: Bully Pulpit, The   Doris Kearns Goodwin

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: The January 1903 issue of McClure's proved that meticulously documented exposure—not rhetoric—is the muckraker's true weapon: by letting facts speak without preaching, Tarbell, Steffens, and Baker united a fractured public across class lines against entrenched corruption, establishing the template every investigative journalist from Carreyrou onward would follow.

> OOSEVELT’S FLAGGING HOPES OF CONFRONTING the trusts, purging corrupt political machines, and checking abuses by both capital and labor were rekindled by the January 1903 publication of

McClure’s

magazine. In this celebrated issue, the

“groundbreaking trio” of Tarbell, Steffens, and Baker produced three exhaustive, hard-hitting investigative pieces that ushered in the distinctive new period of journalism that would later be christened “the muckraking era.” First off, Ida Tarbell revealed the predatory, illegal practices of Standard Oil; Lincoln Steffens then exposed the corrupt dealings of Minneapolis mayor Albert “Doc” Ames; and finally, Ray Baker described the complicity of union members manipulating and deceiving their own fellow workers.

The convergence of these three powerful exposés prompted S. S. McClure to attach an unusual editorial postscript to his January issue, exhorting readers to take action against corruption in every phase of industrial life.

“Capitalists,

workingmen, politicians, citizens—all breaking the law, or letting it be broken,” McClure accused, sparing no one in his sweeping denunciation:

Who is left to uphold it? The lawyers? Some of the best lawyers in this country are hired, not to go into court to defend cases, but to advise corporations and business firms how they can get around the law without too great a risk of punishment. The judges? Too many of them so respect the laws that for some “error” or quibble they restore to office and liberty men convicted on evidence overwhelmingly convincing to common sense. The churches? We know of one [Trinity Church in Manhattan], an ancient and wealthy establishment, which had to be compelled by a Tammany hold-over health officer to put its tenements in sanitary condition. The colleges? They do not understand. There is no one left; none but all of us.

“A lesser editor might have hesitated . . . to print three such contentious papers—arraignments of industry, labor, and government—all in one issue,” observes Peter Lyon, McClure’s biographer, but McClure was resolute. His exceptional sensitivity to the interests of the American public convinced him that people would not shrink from the truth, however dispiriting. He believed, as Steffens later observed, that

“**shameful facts, spread out in all their shame**,” would “set fire to the American pride,” that when people fully realized the corrosive national affliction wrought by unchecked industrialism, they would seek remedies. Yet even the remarkably prescient McClure could not have predicted the extraordinary response his exposés would soon receive from readers across the country.

The January 1903 issue sold out within days, faster than any previous issue. The revelatory articles became a leading topic of conversation in cities and towns across the country. With such incriminating information in the hands of

McClure’s

vast middle-class audience, one historian observes,

“**for the first time considerable numbers of small businessmen and white-collar workers were joining factory hands and farmers in a restless questioning**.” Elated, McClure considered the January issue

“the greatest success we have ever had.”

Editorials in one newspaper after another praised the quality of the research, the dramatic structure of the narratives, the careful documentation.

“Of course, every magazine from time to time had published able articles dealing with some phase of wrong and suggesting some needed reform,” the

New York World

noted. “What Mr. McClure did was to make this work systematic and persistent, to describe realities with absolute frankness, to avoid

preaching, and to let the facts produce their own impression upon the public conscience.”

In the months that followed, the circulation of

McClure’s

### Excerpt 3: Bully Pulpit, The   Doris Kearns Goodwin

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Muckraking's power lay in converting suspicion into substantiated fact—transforming what had been dismissed as the cries of 'prophets in the wilderness' into documented evidence that a mass audience could trust, proving that investigative journalism does not merely report on movements against concentrated power but creates the informational preconditions for them.

> continued to climb as the three writers pursued their investigations. Tarbell’s Standard Oil series eventually stretched over a three-year period; Steffens’s studies of corrupt political machines in a dozen cities and states generated fourteen articles and two books; and Baker produced more than a dozen seminal articles on labor and capital. Baker later attributed the tremendous impact of these meticulously researched exposés to the fact that they finally verified years of

“**prophets crying in the wilderness, and political campaigns based upon charges of corruption and privilege which everyone believed or suspected had some basis of truth, but which were largely unsubstantiated**.” The solid reputation of

McClure’s

and its gifted stable of writers assured millions of Americans they could trust what they were reading.

The success at

McClure’s

persuaded editors and publishers at a dozen leading magazines—including

Collier’s

,

Cosmopolitan

,

Everybody’s

,

Leslie’s

,

Pearson’s

, and

Hampton’s

—to launch similar forays into investigative journalism. Like McClure, these publishers began to funnel substantial resources into the extensive research necessary for such in-depth studies, promoting a new breed of investigative reporter dedicated to extensive fact-finding and analysis. Their disclosures of the corrupt linkages between business, labor, and government educated and aroused the public, spearheading the Progressive movement that would define the early years of the twentieth century.

“It is hardly an exaggeration to say that **the Progressive mind was characteristically a journalistic mind**, and that its characteristic contribution was that of the socially responsible reporter-reformer,” historian Richard Hofstadter observed. “Before there could be action, there must be information and exhortation. Grievances had to be given specific objects, and these the muckraker supplied. It was muckraking that brought the diffuse malaise of the public into focus.”

Y

EARS OF PREPARATORY WORK AND

investigation preceded the publication of

McClure’s

landmark January 1903 issue. As early as the spring of 1899, when few middle-class journals would broach the subject, McClure was already endeavoring to determine how the increasingly vital, complex issue of trusts might engage a wide audience. The English journalist Alfred Maurice Low suggested to McClure that if a single trust were traced from its origin through its

“gradual rise and growth,” an examination of whether malfeasance, wage curtailment, or price inflation had abetted its development would prove “full

of intense human interest.” McClure enthusiastically agreed.

“**The great feature is Trusts**,” he told John Phillips, and the magazine that treats this “great question” will inevitably develop “a good circulation.”

While Phillips embraced McClure’s idea, he insisted the project not be assigned to Low, a reputed sensationalist; better to trust one of their own staff, one trained to rely on substantiated fact rather than overwrought rhetoric.

The McClure team initially considered targeting the sugar or beef trusts, but neither seemed conducive to an extended series. McClure soon struck another approach to the pernicious problem. Several years earlier, after a short story in a small magazine by Frank Norris had attracted his interest, McClure had brought the struggling young author from California to New York, providing him a steady salary to read manuscripts in the mornings, leaving the afternoons free for his own writing. Norris shared McClure’s conviction that writers held a responsibility to the public—not simply to entertain but to address contemporary problems such as corporate avarice and economic injustice.

“The Pulpit, the Press, and the Novel,” Norris argued, “these indisputably are the great moulders of public opinion and public morals to-day.”

One morning, Norris appeared in McClure’s office with an idea for a sprawling trilogy chronicling the struggle between wheat growers and the railroad trust. The first book, to be called

The Octopus

### Excerpt 4: Why Nations Fail  The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty   Daron Acemoglu & James A. Robinson

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Acemoglu and Robinson reveal the structural mechanism through which muckraking translates into lasting reform: Tarbell's exposure of Standard Oil and Brandeis's financial investigations didn't just inform the public—they activated inclusive political institutions to produce the Clayton Act, the FTC, and the Federal Reserve, demonstrating that investigative journalism is the essential catalyst in the virtuous circle between free markets and democratic governance.

> , “**If monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of government**. I do not expect to see monopoly restrain itself. If there are men in this country big enough to own the government of the United States, they are going to own it.”

Wilson worked to pass the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914, strengthening the Sherman Act, and he created the Federal Trade Commission, which enforced the Clayton Act. In addition, under the impetus of the investigation of the Pujo Committee, led by Louisiana congressman Arsene Pujo, into the “money trust,” the spread of monopoly into the financial industry, Wilson moved to increase regulation of the financial sector. In 1913 he created the Federal Reserve Board, which would regulate monopolistic activities in the financial sector.

The rise of Robber Barons and their monopoly trusts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries underscores that, as we already emphasized in

chapter 3

, the presence of markets is not by itself a guarantee of inclusive institutions. Markets can be dominated by a few firms, charging exorbitant prices and blocking the entry of more efficient rivals and new technologies. Markets, left to their own devices, can cease to be inclusive, becoming increasingly dominated by the economically and politically powerful. Inclusive economic institutions require not just markets, but inclusive markets that create a level playing field and economic opportunities for the majority of the people. Widespread monopoly, backed by the political power of the elite, contradicts this. But the reaction to the monopoly trusts also illustrates

that **when political institutions are inclusive, they create a countervailing force against movements away from inclusive markets**. This is the virtuous circle in action. Inclusive economic institutions provide foundations upon which inclusive political institutions can flourish, while inclusive political institutions restrict deviations away from inclusive economic institutions. Trust busting in the United States, in contrast to what we have seen in Mexico (

–

), illustrates this facet of the virtuous circle. While there is no political body in Mexico restricting Carlos Slim’s monopoly, the Sherman and Clayton Acts have been used repeatedly in the United States over the past century to restrict trusts, monopolies, and cartels, and to ensure that markets remain inclusive.

The U.S. experience in the first half of the twentieth century also emphasizes the important role of free media in empowering broad segments of society and thus in the virtuous circle. In 1906 Roosevelt coined the term

muckraker

, based on a literary character, the man with the muckrake in Bunyan’s

Pilgrim’s Progress

, to describe what he regarded as intrusive journalism. The term stuck and came to symbolize journalists who were **intrusively, but also effectively, exposing the excesses of Robber Barons** as well as corruption in local and federal politics. Perhaps the most famous muckraker was Ida Tarbell, whose 1904 book,

History of the Standard Oil Company

, played a key role in moving public opinion against Rockefeller and his business interests, culminating in the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911. Another key muckraker was lawyer and author Louis Brandeis, who would later be named Supreme Court justice by President Wilson. Brandeis outlined a series of financial scandals in his book

Other People’s Money and How Bankers Use It

, and was highly influential on the Pujo Committee. The newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst also played a salient role as muckraker. His serialization in his magazine

The Cosmopolitan

### Excerpt 5: Titan   Ron Chernow

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Rockefeller's contempt for competitors dependent on his infrastructure reveals the psychology that makes monopoly power self-reinforcing and self-justifying—the same psychology that investigative journalists from Tarbell to Carreyrou have had to penetrate, showing that the monopolist always frames predation as efficiency and resistance as ingratitude.

> The immediate-shipment controversy engendered mutual enmity, for Rockefeller saw the producers as so many ingrates and malcontents whose oil was worthless without his superefficient United Pipe Lines system, which would soon be connected to twenty thousand wells. He mockingly described his foes’ attitude as follows: “We have disregarded all advice, and produced oil in excess of the means of storing and shipping it. We have not built storage of our own. How dare you refuse to take all we produce? Why do you not pay us the high prices of 1876, without regard to the fact that the glut has depressed every market?”

6

The episode convinced Rockefeller that the producers nursed an unreasonable hostility against him, and this inoculated him against even valid criticism. But unlike the producers, Standard Oil paid no real penalty for the Bradford crisis and in 1878 declared an impressive $60 dividend on shares with a $100 par value. Rockefeller had positioned himself exactly where he wished to be—**poised to profit from either surplus or scarcity and all but immune to the vagaries of the marketplace**.

As masses of drillers descended upon Bradford, this major shift in the geography of oil awakened dormant ambitions in Rockefeller’s foe, Tom Scott of the Pennsylvania Railroad. As Standard Oil erased the surviving independent refiners, competing pipeline and railroad officials were petrified that Standard might soon be in a position to eliminate their oil traffic at whim. Since it had tracks near the Bradford wells, the Pennsylvania spotted a chance to loosen Standard Oil’s grip and win new business. Its vehicle for this challenge was its assertive subsidiary, the Empire Transportation Company, which owned five hundred miles of pipeline and one thousand tank cars. Empire had had the temerity to threaten Standard Oil in its refining strongholds, buying up rivals in New York, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh and trying to win over new refining customers with bargain transportation rates. Now, as if spoiling for a fight, the Empire began to lay pipes for pumping crude oil from Bradford to the seaboard refineries—a direct challenge to Standard Oil dominance.

The driving force behind this incursion was a man who was

almost

a match for Rockefeller but who fancied that, had Rockefeller only played fair, he would have been much

more

than a match: Colonel Joseph D. Potts, president of Empire Transportation. A civil engineer descended from a family of Quaker ironmasters, Potts was a capable man who had attained a colonel’s rank in the Civil War. He had a prominent nose and a long preacher’s face, fringed by a white beard. Gravely earnest, no less conversant with the Bible than with the oil industry, Potts aspired to be Rockefeller’s equal. If Rockefeller respected Potts’s “indomitable will,” he also patronized him as “a shrewd oily man, as smooth as oil.”

7

Potts repaid the compliment, castigating Rockefeller as a merciless predator. Of Rockefeller’s current refiners’ cartel, the Central Refiners’ Association,

Potts said memorably, “It resembled the gentle fanning of the vampire’s wing, and it had the same end in view—the undisturbed abstraction of the victim’s blood.”

### Excerpt 6: Bad Blood  Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup   John Carreyrou

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Carreyrou's initial skepticism toward Holmes's 'comically vague' scientific claims mirrors Tarbell's instinct to look behind Rockefeller's respectable façade—across a century, the muckraker's method remains unchanged: when the public narrative of genius doesn't survive basic scrutiny, the investigator follows the gap between claim and evidence.

> A chemistry is performed so that a chemical reaction occurs and generates a signal from the chemical interaction with the sample, which is translated into a result, which is then reviewed by certified laboratory personnel.”

Those sounded like the words of a high school chemistry student, not a sophisticated laboratory scientist. The

New Yorker

writer had called the description “comically vague.”

When I stopped to think about it, **I found it hard to believe that a college dropout with just two semesters of chemical engineering courses under her belt had pioneered cutting-edge new science**.

Sure, Mark Zuckerberg had learned to code on his father’s computer when he was ten, but medicine was different: it wasn’t something you could teach yourself in the basement of your house. You needed years of formal training and decades of research to add value.

There was a reason many Nobel laureates in medicine were in their sixties when their achievements were recognized.

Adam said that he’d had a similar reaction to the

New Yorker

piece and that a group of people had contacted him after he’d posted a skeptical item on his blog about it. He was cryptic about their identities and their connection to Theranos at first, but he said they had information about the company I’d want to hear. He said he’d check with them to see if they were willing to talk to me.

In the meantime, I did some preliminary research on Theranos and came across the

Journal

’s editorial-page piece from seventeen months earlier. I hadn’t seen it when it was published. This added an interesting wrinkle, I thought: my newspaper had played a role in Holmes’s meteoric rise by being the first mainstream media organization to publicize her supposed achievements. It made for an awkward situation, but I wasn’t too worried about it. There was a firewall between the

Journal

’s editorial and newsroom staffs. If it turned out that I found some skeletons in Holmes’s closet, it wouldn’t be the first time the two sides of the paper had contradicted each other.

Two weeks after our initial conversation, Adam put me in touch with Richard and Joe Fuisz, Phyllis Gardner, and Rochelle Gibbons. It was disappointing at first to hear that the Fuiszes had been involved in litigation with Theranos. Even if they insisted they’d been wrongly accused, the lawsuit gave them a big ax to grind and made them useless as sources.

But my ears pricked up when I heard that they had talked to Theranos’s just-departed laboratory director and that he was alleging some sort of wrongdoing at the company. I also found the story of Ian Gibbons tragic and was intrigued by the fact that Rochelle said he’d confided to her on several occasions that the Theranos technology wasn’t working. It was the type of thing that would have been dismissed as hearsay in court, but it seemed credible enough to merit a closer look. In order to take this any further, though, what I needed to do next was clear: I needed to talk to Alan Beam.

T

HE FIRST HALF

dozen times I dialed Alan’s number, I got his voicemail. I didn’t leave a message and instead resolved to just keep trying him. On the afternoon of Thursday, February 26, 2015, a voice with an accent I couldn’t quite place finally answered the phone. After ascertaining that it was in fact Alan, I introduced myself and told him I understood he had recently left Theranos with concerns about the way the company was operating.

### Excerpt 7: Bad Blood  Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup   John Carreyrou

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Theranos's deployment of David Boies's legal machinery against whistleblowers and journalists recapitulates the intimidation tactics Standard Oil used against independent producers and critics—demonstrating that across the muckraker's century, concentrated power's first reflex upon exposure is not transparency but legal coercion designed to silence the truth before it reaches the public.

> This firm represents Theranos, Inc. (“Theranos” or the “Company”). We have reason to believe that you have disclosed certain of the Company’s trade secrets and other confidential information without authorization. We also have reason to believe that you have done so in connection with making false and defamatory statements about the Company for the purpose of harming its business. **You are directed to immediately cease and desist from these activities**. Unless this matter is resolved in accordance with the terms set forth in this letter by 5:00 p.m. (PDT) on Friday, July 3, 2015, Theranos will consider all appropriate remedies, including filing suit against you.

The letter went on to say that, if Erika wished to avoid litigation, she must submit to an interview with Boies Schiller attorneys and reveal what information she had disclosed about Theranos and to whom. It was signed by David Boies. Erika drove to Julia’s house and stayed there all weekend with the blinds closed, **too terrified to set foot outside**.

—

B

ACK ON THE OTHER COAST,

I was beginning to sense that things were escalating. That same Friday evening, I got a text from Alan Beam. It was the first I’d heard from him in nearly two months.

“Theranos is threatening me again,” he wrote. “Their lawyers say they suspect I’m violating my affidavit.”

We got on the phone and I filled him in on the marathon meeting with the Theranos delegation at the

Journal

a few days earlier. Rather than scaring him like I worried it might, Alan was fascinated by this new development. He had consulted with a new lawyer, a former federal prosecutor who had worked on the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, and felt less vulnerable to Theranos’s intimidation tactics. In fact, he seemed to have changed his mind and to want to resume helping me get the story out.

Later that night, an email from Meredith Dearborn landed in my in-box.

Attached to it was a formal letter from David Boies addressed to Jay Conti, who was the email’s primary recipient. Citing several California statutes, the letter sternly demanded that the

Journal

“**destroy or return**” all Theranos trade secrets and confidential information in its possession. Even though Boies must have known there was zero chance we would do that, it was a shot across the bow.

Any remaining doubts I had that Theranos was waging an aggressive counterattack were put to rest the following Monday morning. I was sitting in my idled car listening to the radio while waiting for the street-sweeping truck to go by—one of the less pleasant aspects of life in Brooklyn—when my cell phone rang. I turned the volume down on the car radio and answered.

It was Erika and she seemed badly shaken. She told me about the man in the SUV, the address on the envelope, and the ultimatum from Boies. I tried to calm her down. Yes, it was highly likely she was under surveillance, I admitted. But I was sure that it had started only recently and that Theranos had no proof she was one of my sources. This was an attempt to smoke her out, I said. They were bluffing. I encouraged her to ignore the letter and to go about her business as usual. I could tell from her halting voice that she was still petrified, but she agreed to follow my advice.

### Excerpt 8: Bad Blood  Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup   John Carreyrou

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Carreyrou's tribute to his whistleblowers echoes the unnamed oil producers, clerks, and insiders who fed Tarbell her evidence a century earlier—the muckraker's century rests not only on courageous journalists but on the ordinary people inside corrupt institutions who risk everything because they recognize that documented truth is the only counterweight to unchecked power.

> Acknowledgments
This book, which flowed from my work exposing the Theranos scandal in the pages of the
Wall Street Journal,
would not have been possible without the help of the **confidential sources who spoke to me at great personal peril** throughout 2015 and 2016. Some, like Tyler Shultz, have since gone on the record and appear under their real identities in the narrative. Others appear under pseudonyms or are mentioned only as unnamed sources. All were moved to talk to me, despite the legal and career risks they faced, by **one overriding concern: protecting the patients who stood to suffer harm** from Theranos’s faulty blood tests. I will forever be grateful to them for their integrity and their courage. **They are the true heroes of this story**.
This book would also not have been possible without the dozens of other former Theranos employees who overcame their initial skittishness to share their experiences with me and help me reconstruct the company’s fifteen-year history. To a person, they were generous with their time and incredibly supportive of this endeavor. I’m also indebted to the laboratory experts who schooled me in the arcane but fascinating science of blood testing. One of them, Stephen Master of Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York, was kind enough to review the manuscript before publication to help me avoid errors.
This book started with a tip in early 2015. I would like to thank the person who gave me the long leash and the unflinching support I needed to follow that tip where it led: my editor at the
Journal,
Mike Siconolfi. Mike has been a mentor, not just to me but to generations of reporters, and is a standard-bearer for the great journalistic institution that is the
Wall Street Journal
. Mike wasn’t my only ally in the quest to bring these events to light: Jason Conti, now Dow Jones & Co.’s general counsel, and Jacob Goldstein, his deputy, spent countless hours vetting my reporting and batting back the legal threats made by Theranos’s lawyers. I also owe a big debt of gratitude to my investigative team colleague Christopher Weaver, who helped me cover the regulatory inquiries and other fallout for more than a year, including during a stretch when I was on book leave.
One of the dividends of working at the
Journal
has been the friendships I’ve made there over the years. One of those friends, Christopher Stewart, has written several nonfiction books and generously shared with me both his publishing industry expertise and his contacts. It’s through Chris that I met my agent, Eric Lupfer of Fletcher & Company, who immediately saw the potential of this project and pushed me to pursue it despite various obstacles that sprang up along the way. Eric’s perpetual optimism was contagious and the perfect antidote for my moments of doubt.
I am very lucky that this book landed at Knopf and in the deft hands of Andrew Miller. Andrew’s enthusiasm and his unshakable faith in me gave me the confidence I needed to bring it to fruition. I’m also humbled to have had the support of Andrew’s boss, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group chairman Sonny Mehta. From the moment I entered the Random House Tower, Andrew, Sonny, and their colleagues welcomed me and made me feel at home. I hope I have lived up to their expectations.
This saga has consumed the last three and a half years of my life. Through it all, I have been fortunate to be able to rely on the advice, support, and warmth of friends and family. Ianthe Dugan, Paulo Prada, Philip Shishkin, and Matthew Kaminski—to name but a few—provided frequent encouragement and much-needed comic relief. My parents, Jane and Gérard, and my sister, Alexandra, cheered me on to the finish line. But by far my greatest source of strength and inspiration came from the four people with whom I share my life: my wife, Molly, and my three children, Sebastian, Jack, and Francesca. This book is dedicated to them.

### Excerpt 9: Bad Blood  Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup   John Carreyrou

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Holmes's post-publication counterattack—dismissing sources as 'disgruntled' and casting herself as a visionary persecuted by incumbents—mirrors the playbook Rockefeller and every monopolist since has used: reframe exposure as jealousy, discredit witnesses, and appeal to the mythology of progress, forcing the investigative journalist to let documented facts outlast the PR offensive.

> In a press release it posted on its website, the company called the story “**factually and scientifically erroneous and grounded in baseless assertions by inexperienced and disgruntled former employees** and industry incumbents.” It also let it be known that Holmes would appear on Jim Cramer’s

Mad Money

program that evening to rebut the allegations.

We knew that the battle was far from over and that Theranos and Boies would be coming at us hard in the following days and weeks. Whether my reporting stood up to their attacks would largely depend on what actions, if any, regulators took. Rumors had been circulating among former Theranos employees of an FDA inspection, but I hadn’t been able to confirm it by the time we went to press. I had called my source at the agency several times but hadn’t been able to reach him.

I decided to try him again that day before lunch. This time he picked up the phone. On deep background, he confirmed to me that the FDA had recently conducted a surprise inspection of Theranos’s facilities in Newark and Palo Alto. Dealing a severe blow to the company, the agency had declared its nanotainer an uncleared medical device and forbidden it from continuing to use it, he said.

He explained that the FDA had targeted the little tube because, as a medical device, it clearly fell under its jurisdiction and gave it the most solid legal cover to take action against the company. But the underlying reason for the inspection had been the poor clinical data Theranos had submitted to the agency in an effort to get it to approve its tests. When the inspectors had failed to find any better data on-site, the decision had been made to shut down the company’s finger-stick testing by taking away the nanotainer, he said. That wasn’t all: he said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had also just launched its own inspection of Theranos. He didn’t know whether it was still ongoing but was sure it spelled more trouble for the company. Mike and I discussed these revelations and quickly went to work on a follow-up story for the next day’s paper.

A few hours later, I was standing over the shoulder of the page-one editor who was handling my new story when Holmes’s face appeared on a nearby TV tuned to CNBC. We took a break from the edit and turned up the volume.

Dressed in her usual all-black attire and sporting a strained smile, she played the role of the visionary Silicon Valley innovator who was being smeared by entrenched interests trying to thwart progress. “This is what happens when you work to change things,” she said. “First they think you’re crazy, then they fight you, and then all of a sudden you change the world.” But, when Jim Cramer asked her about specific elements of the article, such as the company’s use of third-party analyzers for most of its tests, **she turned defensive and gave evasive and misleading answers**.

I had sent Heather King an email earlier in the day to let her know I was working on a second story and to request a Theranos comment about the things I was going to report. King hadn’t replied. I now knew why: toward the end of her interview with Cramer, Holmes dropped mention of the nanotainer withdrawal and spun it as a voluntary decision. She was trying to get ahead of my scoop.

### Excerpt 10: Alexander Hamilton   Ron Chernow

**Author**: None  
**Connection**: Hamilton's courtroom defense of press freedom—asserting that truth cannot be criminal and that a free press exists to give 'early alarm against the encroachments of power'—provides the constitutional bedrock upon which the entire muckraking tradition stands, from Tarbell's Standard Oil exposé to Carreyrou's Theranos investigation, anchoring the trail's central argument that investigative truth-telling is democracy's indispensable safeguard against concentrated power.

> Only a free press could check abuses of executive power, Hamilton asserted. He never mentioned Jefferson directly, but the president’s shadow flickered intermittently over his speech. In describing the need for unvarnished press coverage of elected officials, Hamilton reminded the judges “how often the hypocrite goes from stage to stage of public fame, under false array, and how often when men attained the last objects of their wishes, they change from that which they seemed to be.” In case any auditors missed the allusion, Hamilton added that “men the most zealous reverers of the people’s rights have, when placed on the highest seat of power, become their most deadly oppressors. It becomes therefore necessary to observe the actual conduct of those who are thus raised up.”

By spotlighting the issue of intent, Hamilton identified the criteria for libel that still hold sway in America today: that the writing in question must be false, defamatory, and malicious. If a published piece of writing “have a good intent, it ought not to be a libel for it then is an innocent transaction.”

21

Hamilton showed how truth and intent were inextricably linked: “Its being a truth is a reason to infer that there was no design to injure another.”

22

He conceded, however, that truth alone was not a defense and that libelers could use “the weapon of truth wantonly.”

23

And he did not argue that the truth should be conclusive, only that it should be admissible; if a journalist slandered his target accurately but maliciously, then he was still guilty of libel. He noted that the Sedition Act, “branded indeed with epithets the most odious,” contained one redeeming feature: it allowed the alleged libeler to

plead both truth and intent before a jury.

24

In deciding intent in libel cases, Hamilton also stressed the need for an independent jury instead of a judge appointed by the executive branch, lest the American judiciary revert to the tyranny of the Star Chamber.

In a ringing summation, Hamilton sounded again like the young firebrand from King’s College days and spoke freely from the heart: “**I never did think the truth was a crime**. I am glad the day is come in which it is to be decided, for my soul has ever abhorred the thought that a free man dared not speak the truth.”

25

The issue of press freedom was all the more important because the spirit of faction, “that mortal poison to our land,” had spread through America. He worried that a certain unnamed party might impose despotism: “**To watch the progress of such endeavours is the office of a free press**. To give us early alarm and put us on our guard against the encroachments of power. This then is a right of the utmost importance, **one for which, instead of yielding it up, we ought rather to spill our blood**.”

26

People who heard Hamilton’s speech that day, which distilled so many themes of his varied career, never forgot his spellbinding message or the mood he cast over the hushed courtroom. James Kent slid a hastily scribbled note to a friend: “

I never heard him so great.

”

27

New York merchant John Johnston wrote afterward, “It was indeed a most extraordinary effort of human genius. . . . [T]here was not, I do believe, a dry eye in court.” Another observer, Thomas P. Grosvenor, confirmed that Hamilton’s speech “drew tears from his eyes and . . . from every eye of the numerous audience.”
